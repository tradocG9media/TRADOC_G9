<p>By Lt. Col Michael C. McCall, Intelligence Branch Chief, ARCIC, February 13, 2015</p>
<p>Is that a Boeing 707 out on a military flight line?  I thought those aircraft had been retired years ago.  This may be the thought running through your head when you see the old bird that made it's first flight more than 57 years ago, which Boeing stopped manufacturing 35 years ago. They can even claim to have flown "The Beatles" to the United States for the first time in this aircraft, back in 1964 when it was state of the art.  However, if you thought these were all retired you would be wrong.  In fact, a select few of these aircraft, now known as the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), still grace the skies carrying sophisticated intelligence equipment, that actively supports the joint force.</p>
<p>JSTARS is a theater Battle Management and C2ISR platform that provides support to joint, interorganizational and multinational commanders and components.  In keeping with the Army Operating Concept, and more specifically the Army Warfighting Challenges (develop and sustain a high degree of situational understanding while operating in complex environments against determined, adaptive enemy organizations) JSTARS contributes to enhancing situational awareness and understanding for ground maneuver commanders throughout the range of military operations, as well as elements conducting Homeland security operations.</p>

<p>Currently, TRADOC is participating in the writing group developing the Capabilities Development Document capturing the requirements for the Next-Generation JSTARS.  TRADOC will help ensure the replacement plan adopts the right mix of capabilities to best support Army and joint needs while reducing operational costs and increasing flexibility.  The plan to replace the current legacy system involves a Business Jet "Biz Jet" model relying on a smaller aircraft and more modern high tech collection equipment while still maintaining the capabilities of the legacy E-8C.  Although the Biz Jet will have a shorter operating range and the radar will have a smaller coverage area, benefits of the new capability will include a higher resolution radar image, reduced manning requirement, the ability to operate from smaller airfields, and a decreased operating cost.</p>
<p>The airborne component consists of the Air Force E-8C (707 variant) aircraft and includes radar, operations and control, and communications subsystems.  The ground-based component of JSTARS includes Army Tactical Ground Stations (TGS) and Marine Corps Tactical Employment Group-Remote Work Stations.   Brigade/regimental combat teams, divisions, and corps have TGS and the TGS can directly link with Army aviation platforms or interorganizational elements.</p>

<p>The radar data collected and processed onboard the E-8C in near-real-time is sent, uninterrupted, to linked TGSs/reception nodes.  The Army aircrew on the E-8C and the TGS operators simultaneously exploit radar data relevant to the ground elements' maneuver, intelligence, and targeting priorities, and all is ingested into Army Mission Command Systems including the Distributed Common Ground Station – Army.</p>
<p>Soldiers from the 138th Military Intelligence Company, the core of Army JSTARS, are the linchpin of all JSTARS radar support to tactical and operational Army Warfighters world-wide. Army JSTARS supports the 461st Air Control Wing (USAF Active Duty) and the 116th Air Control Wing (Georgia Air National Guard) at Robins Air Force Base, Ga.  These Soldiers put the "J" in JSTARS as they form a Joint crew aboard the aircraft.</p>
<p>The new JSTARS is scheduled to begin fielding sometime in late 2022 or 2023.  However, budget reductions are forcing the Air Force to begin phasing out the E-8C in late 2018 creating a 5-year partial gap in this important capability until the Biz Jets begin entering the force.</p>
