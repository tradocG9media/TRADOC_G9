            <h3><strong>Cyberattack No. 1 threat, says brigade commander at NIE 16.1</strong></h3>
            <p><i>By:  David Vergun Army.mil  September 25, 2015</i></p>
            <img class="img-thumbnail img-article-md" src="http://www.army.mil/e2/c/images/2015/09/25/410721/size0.jpg" />

            <p>FORT BLISS, Texas (Army News Service, Sept. 27, 2015) -- "The greatest threat I face as a brigade commander on the battlefield is not [enemy] tanks, snipers or IEDs," said Col. Chuck Masaracchia. "It's defending the network."</p>
            <p>Masaracchia, who is the commander of 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, spoke just prior to the start of Network Integration Evaluation 16.1, or NIE, which runs from Sept. 25 to Oct. 8.</p>
            <p>
                "I am more than confident of our force's capabilities to destroy any force on the battlefield -- as long as we can provide mission command," he said.
The Army is currently facing potential adversaries who are adept at cyberattack, he continued. That enemy has "every capability we have and he will be attacking us" in any future conflict.
"How we try to defend ourselves and not allow him to corrupt the network" will be crucial to determining the outcome, Masaracchia predicted.
            </p>
            <p>The colonel gave a tour of the brigade headquarters in a remote area of Fort Bliss. The headquarters included a tactical assembly area, a tactical assault command post, engineer and artillery battalions, a tactical operation center, a large mobile command center and a smaller mobile command center that mirrored the larger one and could be rapidly deployed to a remote location.</p>
            <p>The brigade headquarters is "organic to the organization," Masaracchia stated proudly. By organic, Masaracchia meant that the use of locals and contractors was not required for it to function, as was the case at forward operating bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. Here, Soldiers and Army civilians did everything, from maintenance and repair to operations.</p>
            <p>
                Masaracchia's brigade is the largest component of NIE 16.1, numbering 4,876 Soldiers among the total 9,000 or so participants. His brigade's operating area is 18,900 square kilometers in Fort Bliss as well as adjacent White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
Besides being in a combat training center-like environment, the brigade will assist in evaluating new and current network equipment to determine if it works with joint and coalition partners. The Soldiers are doing the user evaluating and providing that feedback to vendors on the ground, as well as the Army's own researchers and developers.
            </p>
            
            <h3>PEEK INSIDE THE HONEYCOMB</h3>
            <p>
Two Warfighter Information Network-Tactical Increment 2, or WIN-T, antennas sprouted from a van surrounded by a honeycomb of air conditioned tents swarming with cyber warriors, intelligence analysts and an assortment of technicians. It was a beehive of activity inside the tents.
Disturb the hive and you will get stung, was the message Masaracchia delivered.
"I have [an important] guy who keeps the network secure," he disclosed. That person is Chief Warrant Officer 2 Vladimir Leonard.
