			</div>
<p>Many Soldiers and civilians are unaware that the United States Army possesses a fleet of watercraft.  These assets are often referred to as the "Army's Navy" and run the gamut from small sections of floating causeways to Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) that are 273 feet in length with a cargo carrying capacity of 2,000 tons.  An often asked question is "why does the Army have watercraft in the first place and isn't operating watercraft the job of the Navy"?  USC Title 10 requires the Army to maintain a fleet of organic aircraft and watercraft in order to perform its mission. The Army is also required to maintain the capability to support amphibious operations to include air and watercraft assets (Joint Publication 3-02 Amphibious Operations) and to serve as DoD's seaport managers.  Operating in the same domain does not relegate such operations to a single service.  For example, each service has its own fleet of helicopters which are designed (marinized in some cases), configured (combatant vs. rescue) and operated based on each services unique missions.  Helicopters are not exclusive to the Air Force anymore than trucks are exclusive to the Army.  This same holds true for waterborne assets.  The Army is required to operate seaports as well as conduct a number of "brown water" missions which the "blue water" Navy cannot.  Efficiency studies have been conducted to determine if the Navy would be able to conduct Army waterborne missions.  And each time it has been determined that it would be cost prohibitive for Navy to perform "brown water" missions even with Army assets.  Today's Army watercraft fleet is comprised of 118 vessels and systems with an operating force of 1,728 military mariners and support personnel.</p>
<p>Army maritime assets are manned by Soldier mariners.  This manning strategy provides a level of organic force protection, 24-hour operations, and allows Army watercraft to operate in less than permissive environments.  This is an extraordinarily small, under recognized resource that delivers tremendous value for the joint force commander.  Army watercraft extend a commander's operational reach into the littorals, beaches, and inland waterways.  And most importantly, Army watercraft systems are critical enablers in overcoming austere access challenges.  Army watercraft are designed to operate in austere to bare beach environments.  These unique assets are not dependent upon developed seaports or infrastructure and can operate in shallow draft, littoral and inland waterways.</p>

<p>Today's Army fleet is 118 watercraft, the result of a 50% reduction since 1996 when the fleet was 249 ships (almost as many ships as today's U.S. Navy).  The fleet is also better organized to support a mission set that includes: amphibious and riverine operations; logistics support to joint operations; bare beach operations (logistics over-the-shore); port opening and intermodal operations (to include towing, security, salvage, fire-fighting, and rescue); and intratheater transport of time- sensitive, mission-critical personnel and materiel.  While not specially designed for maneuver/offensive  missions, during the second Gulf War Army watercraft assets were called upon to support seizures of Gulf Oil Platforms in the Arabian Gulf and closure of Naval forces across the beach in Kuwait.</p>
<p>The Army Watercraft Life Cycle Management Strategy (AWLCMS) provides a strategic view of acquisition and modernization requirements.  It describes the priorities and actions that must be taken to ensure the Army's watercraft fleet possesses the capabilities required by the Army's future force during the 2016-2028 timeframe. To deal with such challenges, the Army has developed and implemented a forward deployed and global positioning strategy that supports a more expeditionary minded and agile Army. As a key element of regionally aligned forces,  Army watercraft are stored at prepositioning sites in both CENTCOM and PACOM to be readily available as the need arises and eliminate the need for strategic lift assets to transport watercraft to the theater.</p>

<p>The AWLCMS also reinforces those actions that need to be taken to maintain statutory and regulatory safety and readiness requirements of current watercraft.  The findings of both the Army watercraft and Army terminal operations analyses addresses the need to develop new lift capabilities that match future requirements, but also identified continued service of the LSV and landing craft utility (LCU) as a legitimate mid-term approach to meeting the heavy sustainment lift requirements. Retention of current fleet, in lieu of new procurement, resulted in a requirement to conduct service life extensions program (SLEP) activities on the LCU and LSV as well continued technology insertion in our Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Reshaping the Fleet</p>
<p>The Army Watercraft and Army Terminal Operations analyses also pointed to the brigade-centric force need for lift capability that is able to respond quickly and transition rapidly while operating across a range of battlefield conditions with little or no reliance on external logistics.  This required maneuver capability focuses future Army watercraft investments on developing and procuring the replacement for the Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM-8); cross-services seabasing initiatives; integrated mission command on the move; implementation of Global Combat Support System (GCSS)-Army for Army watercraft; and in the far-term, replacement of the LSV, LCU-2000, and large/small tugs with new platforms.</p>
<p>The release of new strategic guidance and operating concepts now emphasizes the Army's requirement to rapidly deploy tailorable, combat significant forces.  Such short-notice deployments cannot be impeded by austere entry points or area denial tactics employed by an adversary.  This adds operational and tactical maneuver complexities that either taxes or goes beyond the scope of the current fleet's capabilities.  The Army watercraft community has recognized this issue and has spent the last 2 years developing an Army watercraft modernization strategy to meet these expanded roles and missions.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Army recognizes the need for a new generation of Army watercraft.  The current fleet, while possessing a heavy-lift capability, is aging and not properly configured to maneuver combat ready forces.  Judicious steps have been taken to extend the service life of these vessels to obtain the maximum utility possible for each craft.   As a testimony to the success of this effort, the Army routinely performs missions with their three workhorse vessels (LCM-8, LCU-2000, and LSV) which range in age from 20 to over 42 years old.  The Army watercraft fleet has reached the point where it is no longer feasible or fiscally responsible to continue to invest in service life extension programs that simply ensure the current fleet is safe and seaworthy but does not resolve operational gaps.</p>

			<div class="blockcaption" id="cap320">The LCM Future Concept represents the Army's continued investment in this capability to support the Army and Joint Force Commanders.</div>
			</div>
<p>The foundation of the reshaped fleet is the acquisition of a family of maneuver support vessels (MSVs).  These MSVs will be transitioned into the Army watercraft fleet over time, potentially displacing its current lift assets.  This family of MSVs will be comprised of two to three variants that will not only improve the Army's globally responsive sustainment of conventional and Special Forces and will also provide the capability to rapidly maneuver combat configured forces over strategic distances without reliance on improved ports or infrastructure.  The timing of this acquisition and transformation is the critical piece of this initiative.  The acquisition of the MSVs will have to be synchronized with the displacement of the current watercraft fleet.  Careful oversight is required to determine just how long to maintain an existing lift asset before replacement, while considering the increased maintenance investment of an older fleet. As indicated in the CSA strategic priorities, a globally responsive and regionally engaged Army must aggressively pursue improvements to deployment processes to eliminate institutional impediments and expedite movement of ready forces in response to global combatant command requirements.  The biggest challenge facing both current and future Army watercraft is the uncertain fiscal climate.  In today's austere budgetary environment, competition for resources is fierce and sound and rigorous requirements generation essential.  The MSV-L is currently in the analytical phase of the acquisition process.  This phase is the most critical in shaping the attributes and costs of these vessels.  The key to successfully bringing this new force projection asset into the Army is effective trades between capabilities and costs while ensuring our Army can rapidly deploy, fight, and win, whenever and wherever our national interests are threatened.</p>
