<p class="BubbleTitleSub">Cluster Munitions No More: What this means for the U.S. Military</p>
<p>By Mike Jacobson, Fires Division, ARCIC, September 5, 2014</p>
<p>The United States will end the use of cluster munitions by January 2019.  In 2008, when the U.S. government committed itself to disposing of cluster munitions by January 2019, it seemed distant. However, when the Department of Defense (DoD) implements the final phase of this policy, it will deprive itself of a critical capability without an identical replacement.</p>

<p>Cluster munitions are "munitions composed of a non-reusable canister or delivery body containing multiple, conventional, explosive submunitions" delivered by aircraft, cruise missiles, artillery, mortars, missiles, tanks, rocket launchers, and naval cannons. The Department of Defense developed cluster munitions during the Cold War to saturate likely Soviet mechanized and armored forces avenues of approach into Western Europe with armor-killing munitions.  For example, the typical howitzer- launched cluster munition, the most numerous and, arguably, most important of U.S. cluster munitions, can equal the lethal effectiveness of 15 high explosive howitzer shells. The advantages of such a munition are fairly obvious.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">The Cluster Munition Debate</p>
<p>Presently, no identical replacement has been identified for the vast stockpile of U.S. Army and Marine Corps howitzer cluster munitions scheduled for elimination in several years. Elimination of the cluster munition created an important debate within the DoD community regarding the need for a comparable replacement. The debate hinges on a perception of a very low likelihood of future conflicts involving large enemy armor and infantry formations, leading to the elimination of large scale area artillery fire in combat and shifting toward precision unitary artillery fire.  Advocates of this position point to the experiences of the past 13 years of low-intensity warfare, in which U.S. forces did not employ cluster munitions. They are further bolstered by the downward pressure on the U.S. defense budget, which does not currently support an identical replacement capability.</p>
<p>Supporters also argue that future state adversaries will not apply combined-arms maneuver against the United States because of our overmatch in technology, particularly when it comes to air superiority.  However, proponents of eliminating the cluster munition dismiss the capabilities of America's most dangerous adversaries.  If DoD does not invest in a replacement capability it will leave U.S. ground forces at a dangerous disadvantage on future battlefields.  Furthermore, by removing a key American deterrent, current and future adversaries may become more aggressive.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">The Oslo Treaty</p>
<p>The 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, commonly referred to as the Oslo Treaty, has two aims. The first is to reduce unintended harm to civilians by minimizing the indiscriminate effects of area fires (intended to inundate a target area greater than 200 square meters with explosive destruction) on the battlefield.  Area fires are more likely to cause collateral damage and civilian casualties.  The second is to eliminate the large amount of unexploded sub-munitions, or bomblets, commonly found in areas where cluster munitions have been fired. Up to five percent of bomblets from cluster munitions may not explode when fired, which can wreak havoc on local civilian populations for years.</p>
<p>The Oslo Treaty prohibits signatories from manufacturing, acquiring, distributing, or using cluster munitions. Although the United States is not a signatory to the treaty, the Bush Administration supported the spirit of the treaty, as does the Obama Administration.  The Bush Administration directed DoD to implement a policy to meet the intent of the treaty but to do so without giving up a key capability for an interim period while the Services determine how to replace the capability.</p>
<p>The DoD policy began to take effect in 2009. All such munitions which could not achieve an unexploded ordinance rate of less than one percent (which includes all U.S. artillery munitions) were immediately placed under the release authority of the Combatant Commander. No artillery cluster munitions were fired in Operation Iraqi Freedom following the end of the forced entry phase of operations (declared by President Bush on May 1, 2003) or Operation Enduring Freedom. The policy gave the Services a 10-year grace period to determine the requirement for a replacement, conduct research and development, and acquire sufficient new munitions. To date the services, with the exception of the Army, have failed to accomplish any of these activities, despite a clause within the policy that acknowledges the importance of this capability.  The policy states,</p>
<blockquote>[T]here remains a military requirement to engage area targets that include massed formation of enemy forces, individual targets dispersed over a defined area, targets whose precise locations are not known, and time-sensitive or moving targets.  Cluster munitions can be the most effective and efficient weapons for engaging these types of targets.</blockquote>
<p>Even the State Department agrees. As of today, a State Department webpage explains:</p>
<blockquote>Cluster munitions have demonstrated military utility. Their elimination from U.S. stockpiles would put the lives of its soldiers and those of its coalition partners at risk. Moreover, cluster munitions can often result in much less collateral damage than unitary weapons, such as a larger bomb or larger artillery shell would cause, if used for the same mission.</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. Army developed a new warhead for its Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System that will service large, soft-skinned, area targets such as encampments, infantry in the open, and truck formations. But this munition is allocated to corps and division level and may not always be readily available to tactical formations at brigade, battalion, and company level.</p>
<p>For land forces at the tactical level of engagement, the most important system today for prosecuting area targets is 155mm artillery Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition M483A1. The projectile is equipped with a time fuze that is set to release the cargo of sub-munitions at the recommended height above the target (which varies based on the size and density of the target as well as the number of howitzers available to mass fires on the target) and saturate the area with bomblets. The M483A1 carries 88 bomblets (with a shaped charge for armor penetration) each with a lethal radius of approximately ten square meters. The dispersion area is between 1-3 hectares (a hectare is 100 meters x 100 meters) depending on the height of burst. The higher the height of burst, the broader the dispersion. Harder targets require denser dispersion. Shaped charges that strike an armored target create a metallic jet that perforates metallic armor. Some modern medium battle tanks of many advanced states (i.e., NATO, Russia, China, etc.) can take the hit, but others cannot. Generally, 10 or more bomblet strikes are required for an armored-vehicle kill, but a single bomblet can result in fire-power or mobility kill. The detonation and most fragmentation travel downward therefore most lethal effects are close to the surface.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Capability Gap</p>
<p>Reliance on precision creates a new capability gap when prosecuting hardened targets that cannot be precisely located (i.e., armored fighting vehicles and tanks). Cluster munitions, with their saturative effects, were designed for exactly this purpose.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of engaging concealed, hardened targets is reduced when using unitary munitions.  Potential consequences include decreased lethality, increased munitions expenditure, and increased targets requiring engagement with direct fire weapon systems, thus increasing risk to soldiers and marines.</p>

<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Mitigating the Capability Gap</p>
<p>The DoD possesses a munition in its inventory that may mitigate the capability gap against imprecisely located hardened and armored targets that does not involve a one for one replacement of the stockpile of cluster munitions currently in the inventory.  The answer may be sensor-fuzed munitions.  This is a family of munitions that are employed by firing them in an area where enemy vehicles are thought to be located; the munition fuze will then seek out objects on the ground for which its sensors are designed.  Having located a target, moving or stationary, the munition then guides to and detonates precisely on the target using its own sensors and without reliance on GPS.  The United States fielded such a munition to great effect during Desert Storm in the form of SADARM (Sense and Destroy Armor).  However, the munition was not pursued because at the time the large quantities of cluster munitions made the acquisition of this relatively expensive boutique munition unaffordable.  That calculus has changed.  The number of SADARM type munitions that would be required in today's war reserve would be comparatively small, probably less than 10,000, due to the relatively small number of targets it would service and the low likelihood of a conflict in which such weapons would be employed. This solution would do nothing to mitigate the decreased effectiveness against soft area targets but greater reliance on corps and division artillery and direct-fire assets would reduce the risk to ground forces.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Conclusion</p>
<p>Artillery cluster munitions continue to be a highly effective capability when employed against the right target types under the right conditions.  No amount of quantitative analysis against less than peer competitors will illustrate the overall risk to U.S. and Coalition ground forces when artillery cluster munitions are no longer available.  What has been confirmed through the sum of U.S. and international assessments is that technological advancements have greatly reduced the need for cluster munitions and when taken in the context of collateral damage it just makes sense to phase out this capability.  However, doing so creates additional operational risk in our ground forces that has been mitigated by cluster munitions since the 1970's.  Advances in precision technology coupled with development of a new sensor-fuzed artillery munition will not only close the gap but arguably increase the lethal effectiveness of ground force indirect fires against armored and hardened targets.</p>
