<p class="BubbleTitleSub">The Caged Lion: A Short Analysis of British Military Expeditionary Capability in the Days of Austerity</p>
<p>By ARCIC International Army Programs Directorate (IAPD), March 28, 2014</p>
<p>The British military is easily among the most professional and capable military forces in the world. It has a long history of punching above its weight and winning when victory seemed impossible. In the current political environment Her Majesty's Government seeks to reduce military expenditure while maintaining strategic and ideological commitments. This reduction in military spending has greatly reduced the British military's ability to unilaterally project expeditionary power across the globe. In effect the British lion is caged upon its island.</p>

			</div>
<p>This article is an analysis of British expeditionary capability as seen through the eyes of the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Liaison Officer to the British Army's Land Warfare Center (referred to as US LO) while accompanying the British Development, Concepts, and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) staff on its battlefield study of Operating at Range (Expeditionary Operations). DCDC conducted this study through the lens of Operation Corporate, the British operation to liberate the Falkland Islands in 1982.</p>
<p>The study consisted of historical analysis of Operation Corporate and contemporary analysis of current British capability to project expeditionary power in general and in the Atlantic specifically. The DCDC team used the staff ride format to visit Ascension Island in the central Atlantic Ocean and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. These locations were instrumental in understanding Operation Corporate and the British military's expeditionary capability. The resulting analysis suggested that current British doctrine for expeditionary operations is well-established and thoroughly capable, but they currently are not funded adequately to execute unilateral expeditionary operations without exposing their forces to significant risk. As a result of funding shortfalls British forces cannot effectively isolate an operational objective in an expeditionary environment, nor can they properly sustain themselves once ashore.</p>
<p>British Military doctrine is currently capable of accurately directing requirements for expeditionary operations, but there appears to be dissonance between British military doctrinal concepts and the availability of assets to enable that doctrine. Study of Operation Corporate and subsequent discussions about current British doctrine illustrated that expeditionary concepts of maneuver, sustainment, and mission command are present and well understood among British leadership. However, the British military does not possess the assets required for operating an expeditionary military force on a unilateral operation where the operation requires forces larger than a battle group and the threat to forces in theater is of such magnitude that those forces could conceivably be destroyed.</p>
<p>In the context of history, Operation Corporate achieved its objectives, but its cost in men and materiel was greater than necessary if British forces had been equipped and sustained to execute the operation as doctrine of the day dictated, even within the constraints of the political objectives. Instead, absolutely heroic efforts were required in 1982 on the parts of all services to isolate the objective, generate combat power ashore, sustain forces in theater, secure those forces, and accomplish the primary mission. Though the British military learned the lessons of Operation Corporate well, and clearly knows what it needs to protect its forces while efficiently accomplishing future expeditionary operations, the availability of assets to support this doctrine remains elusive.</p>
<p>As the British government seeks to support emerging United Nations doctrine and international norms regarding the international responsibility to protect , British military forces are underfunded and under-supported to achieve those policy objectives without subjecting forces to significant risk. Current funding inadequacies require the British military to find doctrinal and operational solutions that place the burden of mission success on personnel and organizational innovation. This was historically apparent in the study of Operation Corporate as sea, air, and ground forces were routinely required to sacrifice casualties, tempo, mass, and maneuver as a result of insufficient availability of materiel intertwined with aggressive military and political objectives.</p>
<p>A lack of readily available capability in the form of materiel and deployable forces leads directly to a practical problem at the operational level for British forces. Doctrine regarding expeditionary operations (employed with operational maneuver as opposed to forced entry) requires that the initial objective be effectively isolated from enemy interference while friendly forces generate sufficient combat power and sustainment capability in the objective area to support follow on operations. British forces currently lack sufficient air and sea assets capable of effectively projecting enough power that a future objective can be properly isolated from a reasonably capable enemy while British forces generate capacity ashore.</p>

<p>This is not to imply that forces could not be landed and objectives reached, rather it implies that the cost in losses of men and equipment conducting this type of operation would perhaps be prohibitively high. Historically this is demonstrated by Operation Corporate as losses from enemy action up to and during the landing of the landing force totaled eight ships damaged and one sunk, two harriers and six helicopters destroyed, and about 60 personnel killed (dependent on when the landing is considered complete). British capability to isolate an objective at range during 1982 exceeded current conventional capability today. This is most visible through the absence of aircraft carriers and carrier-based aircraft today, but also through the fewer (though more capable) ships available to the Royal Navy (RN), and the absence of intercontinental strategic bombing and reconnaissance capability in the Royal Air Force (RAF). Therefore, there is unlikely to be a less costly outcome for men and equipment under similar conditions in the future.</p>
<p>The second practical problem at the operational level is the insufficient sustainment capability currently available to expeditionary British forces. Current ship to shore movement capability is almost entirely reliant on helicopters and a few (fairly elderly and incapable) landing craft. There is also only a very small capability to extend sustainment over land once in theater. In cases like Operation Corporate the British were forced to rely almost exclusively on helicopter support if not the backs of their soldiers. In modern cases like the British assistance to French forces in Mali, British contingents were forced to employ services like DHL and local businesses to create capability to deliver timely sustainment in necessary quantities.</p>
<p>As in Operation Corporate, current airlift capability does not meet projected sustainment demand, and ship-to-shore and ground-based systems are not capable of moving enough materiel to meet demand (of forces exceeding Battle Group size) without large forward operating bases and coalition help (as in Afghanistan). There is no indication that this will change in the future. In fact, it is likely that the opposite will be true as British forces plan and train to operate almost exclusively inside a US coalition and thus make use of the more robust US sustainment capability.</p>
<p>The lessons of Operation Corporate have been well-heeded by the British military establishment, and current doctrine demonstrates this. British doctrine provides for all generally accepted practices when conducting expeditionary operations or Operations at Range. The shortfall is not doctrinal. The shortfall is in materiel, and thus expeditionary capability. British planning assumes generally that future operations will be conducted within a large coalition almost certainly led by the United States. That assumption must be incorporated into doctrine on both sides of the Atlantic. If the British military is going to rely on the United States for a large proportion of its sustainment and expeditionary capability during future contingency operations, then both sides need to plan and allocate resources for this assumption. U.S. planning assumptions must also include which specific tasks of expeditionary operations will be routinely ceded to the U.S. and then develop sufficient capability for that assumption. British forces are impressive, and anyone who has served with them can attest to their outstanding tactical ability, courage, and leadership, but until military funding reaches levels to enable expeditionary capability to meet doctrinal requirements and ultimately strategic policy goals, the British lion will remain caged on its island waiting for a U.S. coalition to release it.</p>
