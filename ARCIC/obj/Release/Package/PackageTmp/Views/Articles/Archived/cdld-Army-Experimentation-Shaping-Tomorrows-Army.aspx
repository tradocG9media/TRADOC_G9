<p>Experimentation drives change.  It is a means to stimulate imagination and increase awareness of the "weak signals" of impending change.  It allows us to see ourselves and the enemy differently - shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance that allows us to recognize and influence change before "strong signals" force us to adapt on others' terms.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Battle Labs reside in each Center of Excellence (CoE), and are equipped with a capacity and infrastructure that enables each to modernize its warfighting function.  By integrating the warfighting functions, experimentation conducted at these labs enables ARCIC to understand interactions between warfighting functions, among our sister services, and our multinational partners. This identifies interdependencies, gaps, and redundancies, allowing the Army to shape a holistic and coherent transition from the current force to the future force.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">WHAT IS EXPERIMENTATION?</p>
<p>First, it's important to distinguish an experiment and an evaluation.  Experiments immerse Soldiers into a future Joint Operating Environment. It positions them against a thinking, adaptive enemy in order to learn and mitigate risk.  Evaluations connect Soldiers to mature network capabilities in order to determine whether they perform as needed, conform to the network architecture, and are interoperable with existing systems.  Other differences include: concepts versus doctrine; transitioning the force versus developing the future force; mid-term versus near-term; technology readiness levels 3-6 versus levels 7-8.</p>

<p>The TRADOC Commanding General, Gen. Robert Cone, and Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. Ray Odierno, tasked Army Experimentation to assess the functional integration of future Army initiatives to help shape the Army of 2020 and beyond.  Simultaneous and complex design changes have been integrated into Army-level experiments across Joint Campaign Phases 0-IV.  During each phase of the operation, running estimates are maintained to isolate critical design changes which result in new planning considerations and employment capabilities.  The end state is a functionally integrated collection of observations, insights and recommendations across the DOTMLPF spectrum that, to date, have developed evolving future Army doctrine, identified non-resident, atrophied and new training skills, and will recommend improvements to future Army force design.   The culminating event will be conducted by Eighth Army, who will "bench test" the DOTMLPF solutions during its December Mission Command Training Program Warfighter Exercise in order to help shape the future Army.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">REBALANCING THE ARMY</p>
<p>As the Army redesigns to a smaller end-strength, experimentation will play a critical role in ensuring that we have the right capabilities and force mix to be operationally effective.  More importantly, it will ensure the Army invests in the capabilities it will need instead of what is merely available.</p>
