<p>Force 2025 and Beyond is the Army's strategy to ensure the future joint force can win in a complex world.  Force 2025 improves the force's lethality, mobility, survivability, and expeditionary capabilities.  In accordance with the Army Operating Concept (AOC), Army forces will provide the foundational capabilities required by the joint force.  These foundational capabilities include command and control, along with the ability to project power onto land and from land across the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.</p>
<p>The Army will develop the future force collaboratively with joint commands, sister services, industry, academia, inter-organizational, and multi-national forces.  These efforts will guide changes to Army doctrine, organizations, training, materiel (equipment) development, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF).</p>
<p>As the Army focuses on the future, Force 2025 Maneuvers provides the means to evaluate and validate Brigade Combat Team (BCT) expeditionary capabilities in support of joint operations.  The associated wargames, exercises, experiments, evaluations, and other efforts will spur innovation, integrating efforts, and maintaining accountability through the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs).</p>

<p>The intellectual foundation of Force 2025 and Beyond is the Army Vision, reinforced through the AOC. The Army Vision has three main components; 1. Regionally engaged and globally responsive; 2. Provide a full range of capabilities to combatant commanders and other interorganizational, or multinational organizations; and 3. Operate as part of the joint force with agility, versatility and depth to Prevent, Shape, and Win.</p>
<p>The AOC describes how future Army forces operate with other U.S. and foreign organizations to accomplish campaign objectives and protect U.S. national interests.  The AOC guides future force development through the identification of first order capabilities the Army requires to accomplish missions supporting U.S. policy goals and objectives. The AOC serves as a foundational document for several Army strategic documents, such as the Army Strategic Plan, Army Campaign Plan and Army Equipment Modernization Plan.</p>
<p>The Army will foster a culture of innovation to accomplish Force 2025.  Over the past 13 years, the Army successfully focused its innovation efforts against near-term problems.  The new challenge is balancing near, mid, and far demands, which requires calculating investment risk across time, and resetting the institution to innovate with less money across a complex set of problems.  Technological innovations represent one small aspect of innovation.</p>
<p>As the foundation of joint forces, the Army will lead the joint community at innovating new and enhanced training systems, organization, and joint operational concepts.  The future of U.S. warfare is both joint and multinational, and all innovation must consider our international partners.</p>
<p>Several activities will drive the development of future capabilities.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Concepts to Capabilities: Building the Future Force</p>
<p>Ensuring future Army forces are prepared to win in a complex world requires a focused, sustained, and collaborative effort across the institutional Army, the operating force, the joint community, industry, academia, and other inter-organizational and multinational partners.  Concepts aligned with the Army's warfighting functions help identify required capabilities for future Army forces.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">The Army Warfighting Challenges</p>
<p>The AWFCs provide the analytical framework to integrate efforts across warfighting functions while collaborating with key stakeholders in learning activities, modernization, and future force design.  AWFCs are enduring first order problems, the solutions to which improve the combat effectiveness of the current and future force.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Force 2025 Maneuvers: The Campaign of Learning</p>
<p>Force 2025 Maneuvers encompass the intellectual (studies, analysis, concept, capabilities development) and physical (experimentation, evaluations, exercises, modeling, simulations, wargames) activities that help leaders integrate future capabilities and develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges.  Using the AWFCs as the analytical framework, the Army conducts Force 2025 Maneuvers to develop concepts, operational and organizational plans, DOTMLPF solutions, leader and Soldier assessment tools, and policy solutions to achieve the vision of the Army's future force.</p>

<p>Only through studying the continuities of war, understanding the changing character of armed conflict, and applying purposeful design to future forces will the Army deliver the capabilities required to win in a complex world.</p>
