<p>By Army Capabilities Integration Center, January 24, 2014</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) engages 16 partner armies through the Foreign Liaison Officer (FLO) program at Ft. Eustis in Virginia.  FLOs assigned to Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) observe and interact with capability developers, trainers, and Army leaders who help them gain a better understanding of how our Army is transforming.  This program strengthens our relationships with these countries, improves understanding and future interoperability and is an essential part of TRADOC's contribution to the Army's security cooperation efforts.</p>

<p class="BubbleTitleSection">First Stop – Fort Lee, VA</p>
<p>The first leg of a recent multinational series of engagements kicked off at the Army's Sustainment Center of Excellence (SCOE) at the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) located in Ft. Lee, VA.</p>
<p>The SCOE described their contributions to training, leader education and capability developments that will provide the Army with globally responsive logistics.  After exposure to CASCOM priorities and capability development efforts, a discussion on the Logistics Leader Development Strategy was facilitated by the Army's Logistics University.  The FLOs dined in the Army's second-largest dining facility located on the Ordnance Campus, which is capable of feeding over 3,500 Soldiers each meal.  Following a brief lunch the FLOs received hands-on exposure to computer enhanced, deployable machining capabilities that enable Army maintainers to reverse-engineer equipment parts and produce them in the field – a capability that helps with battle damage repair and interoperability with foreign partners.</p>
<p>The Ordnance School demonstrated their welding simulator that is used to improve welder training and reduce materiel costs.  Several FLOs attempted to simulate a weld while coached by an instructor, doing quite well for their first attempt.  The visit finished with a walk-through of the 91B Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic training bays where training is transitioning to a skill-based format to improve training effectiveness and reduce overall training time.</p>

<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Second Leg – Fort Riley, KS</p>
<p>The second leg of the fall FLO engagement was Ft. Riley, Kansas including a visit to the Big Red 1.Here FLOs spoke with the Deputy Division Commander and the commanders and staff of 2 battalions that comprise the Army's first regionally aligned brigade.  2nd Armor Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) of the 1st Infantry Division (1 ID) was allocated to support theater security cooperation (TSC) missions in Africa beginning last March.</p>
<p>The Brigade has adapted to the challenge of being both decisive action capable for unified land operations and understanding the softer skills of culture, regional expertise and language (CREL) required for TSC.  2/1 ID provided an overview of their mission, TSC planning and execution in support of US Army Africa and AFRICOM.  2/1 ID partnered with the 162 IN BDE at Ft. Polk, the US Army Peace Keeping and Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI), Kansas State University and others to provide its soldiers with realistic and relevant CREL training.  Discussions continued with the staff through lunch as the FLOs joined them in their dining facility.</p>
<p>At the same time, 1-18 IN BN was undergoing decisive action company level training.  The FLOs were invited to and participated in the 1-18 IN BN company level situational training exercise after action review where saw how the Army is refining basic combat skills that have atrophied over the past 10 years of counter insurgency and nation-building missions.</p>
<p>The final leg of the FLO fall engagement trip highlighted one of the Army's most modern and realistic combat training centers and the nation's premier security force assistance training brigade, the 162 Infantry.  The 162nd provided a mission brief and discussed the challenges of Security Force Assistance (SFA) training and their role in the Dagger University established by 2/1 ID at Ft. Riley.</p>
<p>Continuing on to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), the FLOs were provided an overview briefing by the JRTC Operations Group.  The overview gave them insights into exercise planning and execution, as well as resources and training required by observer / controller / trainers and the opposing forces know at the JRTC as "Geronimo".</p>
<p>The following day the FLOs were permitted to observe, close up, a mission rehearsal exercise evaluation being conducted for the 101st ABN DIV.  The first of 2 training lanes the FLOs observed was reacting to a simulated sniper attack in an Afghan village and evacuating casualties with sporadic enemy activity.</p>

<p class="BubbleTitleSection">More FLO Training: Convoy Ops, DATE, and JRTC Simulations</p>
<p>The second training lane focused on convoy operations.  The training unit was working with Afghan forces, portrayed by local actors, to provide humanitarian relief supplies.  The FLOs visited the evaluated unit's brigade tactical operation center (TOC) and then visited a simulated Afghan brigade TOC complete with Afghan staff role players.</p>
<p>The Commanding General (CG), JRTC hosted the FLOs for lunch at the Special Operations Training Detachment where they discussed many topics including the Decisive Action Training Environment (DATE), special force and conventional force interoperability and regionally aligned forces.</p>
<p>Following lunch with the CG, JRTC the FLOs visited the supporting JRTC simulations center where they observed the training in a virtual environment.  The simulation center discussed how they simulate units and stimulate the exercise through their automation tools.  The formal part of the trip ended with an overview of the JRTC Leader Training Program that prepares commanders and staff for their training and ultimately for their deployment to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>While in Louisiana the FLOs were also exposed to American culture and southern hospitality.  They dined in several local restaurants sampling Cajun cuisine such as crawfish etouffee and blackened gator.</p>
