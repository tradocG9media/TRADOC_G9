<p>Warfare is an inherently human endeavor utilizing tools to achieve effects.  Since the first human picked up a stone as a weapon, the race for increasingly sophisticated tools of war has gone unabated.  The development from simple Stone Age weapons to today's modern precision guided munitions has required extensive investment and research into Science and Technology (S&T) to gain or maintain an edge on an opponent.    The changing nature of scientific discovery and its impact on emerging social, political, economic trends require the nation, especially the Army, to continue its investment in S&T to maintain its competitive edge.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">THE OPERATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE</p>
<p>Future global conditions will differ from the current operating environment in critical ways:  networked populations will have immediate awareness of global issues and be capable of networked action; shifting and devolving power centers will complicate the operating environment; proliferating technologies will increase access to advanced capabilities by more actors capable of achieving strategic effects; the increased speed at which events unfold will reduce the timeline for response; and the probability of local events affecting the strategic environment will increase exponentially.   Additionally, demographic, political, and economic considerations will likely limit military funding and manpower.</p>
<p>These trends will demand the future force to rapidly deliver military effects at the speed events unfold, with less total manpower.</p>
<p>Historically, previous investments enabled the Army to deliver greater effects from similarly sized units.  The anticipated speed of change is likely to demand greater increases in Army capabilities for 2025 and beyond.   However, current modernization investment is unlikely to deliver much beyond incremental improvements in performance.  Fielding new and significantly more effective systems in the 2030s will require high levels of technological maturity by 2020.  Without shifting the focus of S&T efforts and modernization priorities, the technologies supporting future capabilities may be inadequate to meet future challenges.</p>
<p>Ensuring we have the right capabilities will require focused efforts in fundamental scientific research to further leverage and exploit emerging Life Science and Advanced Materials "revolutions."  Revolutions in Advanced Decision-Making Tools focusing on advanced mathematics and statistical computational tools for analyzing and fusing information; exploitation of the Life Sciences yielding significant enhancement of human performance and Advanced Materials will physically change the Army without reducing our punch.</p>
<p>Improved agility and responsiveness can come from Advanced Materials with equivalent or greater protection and significantly lower platform and soldier equipment weights.  Discriminant lethal and overmatching capabilities are possible by combining these physical gains with the power of advanced computing and improved solider cognitive and physical performance to gain situational awareness, decision superiority, reduce tactical surprise, increase lethality, and operate at greater tempo.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">ACCELERATED INFORMATION TO DECISIONS</p>
<p>Advanced Decision-Making Tools will play a major role in addressing the challenges of the dynamic and complex future operational environment through massive computing power and processing speed.  Advanced computing offers the opportunity for greater situational understanding and decision superiority and enables agile forces with more punch and protection.  Quantum advances in computing may accelerate the speed of information management as well as provide unbreakable encryption, unassailable cyber defenses, and overpowering cyber attacks.</p>
<p>By leveraging advances in computational power, the network will provide real-time and relevant information to the Soldier at the point of need and at the speed of change and war.  This effort is clearly cross-domain and will demand the integration of all sensors into the information network.  This will require innovative ways of automating the information management network to get real time and relevant information down to the lowest tactical level similar to search capabilities of Google; but in this case, the relevant information needs to be pushed instead of pulled using a hands-free interface that gives Soldiers and leaders complete situational awareness with the ability to zoom in and zoom out as the tactical and operational situation unfolds.</p>
<p>Today almost all of the information coming into a young leader is through the same type of radio handset that his father used in the first Gulf War and Panama, his grandfather used in Vietnam, and his great grandfather used in WWII.  The soldier of 2035 will wear an advanced combat multi-capable helmet with a hands-free heads-up display (HUD).  Much or all of the communication will come in through the helmet and eliminate the need for a hand-held microphone.  The HUD and advanced combat helmet will also assist with target acquisition, real time written and oral translation (both ways), intelligence dissemination (up, down, and horizontal), and even include the control of the semi-autonomous wingmen (both ground and air).</p>
<p>With access to real-time and relevant information, the Soldier and leader will be empowered to minimize surprise, seize and maintain the initiative, and conduct multi-dimensional operations.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">ADVANCED MATERIALS</p>
<p>Advances in material science will underpin more agile and robust platforms and equipment for the Army of 2030-2040.  Material science gains of the past twenty years, significantly reducing weight of protective armor, will be offset by the emerging 360 degree battlefield geometry and increasing threat lethality.  Soldier protection, though critical to mission success, has increased system weights and Soldier loads, hampered force projection and increased sustainment requirements.  Significant scientific breakthroughs could yield materials that are ultra-light but provide the required protection and survivability, and allow timely force deployment.</p>
<p>Converting from analog to digital systems significantly increased the strategic, operational, and tactical cognitive agility of the Army.  Advanced materials, i.e., changing what the Army is "made" of, will increase the physical agility of the Army in similar ways.  Combining enhanced cognitive and physical agility from the strategic to the tactical level will enable the Army to quickly deliver military effect at the speed events unfold; the same effect with less manpower, or significantly greater effect with the same levels of manpower.</p>
<p>Advanced materials can break the direct relationship between protection and material/system weight.  In the face of increasing lethality, greater protection has produced heavier platforms and soldier loads, challenging mobility, increasing the physical burden, limiting deployment options, and increasing support demands that drive unfavorable tooth-to-tail ratios.  Lightweight advanced materials can reverse this progression.  This could improve agility, maintain protection, and reduce sustainment demands with the potential to flatten or, better, invert the tooth-to-tail ratio.</p>
<p>The second and third order effects of advanced materials will be significant.  The benefits of materials such as carbon fiber are well known, but cost and physical properties can preclude widespread use.  Advances in material science, such as nanotechnology, biomimetic materials, and additive manufacturing, have great promise to overcome these limits.  The first combatant to capitalize on these possibilities will gain an important operational advantage.  A significant increase in the amount and focus of our advanced materials investment is necessary to provide achievable options for the future.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">HUMAN PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (HPO)</p>
<p>By 2025, the empowerment of more non-state and individual actors will demand greater presence and engagement by land forces with populations residing in key regions of the globe.  Soldiers and leaders will be both empowered and challenged by the speed and complexity of future combat, the quantity of information, and near-instant access to Army/Joint fires and effects to the lowest levels.  Accelerating the cognitive and physical development and abilities of our Soldiers and leaders will allow them to seize and maintain the initiative and exploit decision superiority that turns data into decisions quicker, overmatching our opponents in an increasingly complex and lethal environment.</p>
<p>Today, Soldiers and leaders require years of training, experience, and echeloned decision-making to properly employ Army/Joint capabilities.  Improving cognitive and physical performance creates opportunities for Soldiers and leaders to do this earlier in their career and at lower levels.  However, current policies and ethical norms resist HPO, while adversaries actively pursue this technology, without limitations.  Even so, acting now, consistent with U.S. policy and norms, can ensure tomorrow's Soldier maintains a significant advantage over our enemies on an enhanced human battlefield.</p>
<p>There are three primary approaches to HPO.  First, human cognition as a computational problem leverages advanced computing to amplify human perception, learning, and reasoning to accelerate cognitive ability and enable simultaneous management of more complex interactions and integration of more dynamic effects.  Second, human cognition and physical performance as a biological problem, (sports medicine, tissue engineering and methods of fatigue control) enables greater physical and mental workloads, and improves Soldier and leader endurance, resilience and recovery.  Third, advanced Brain-Computer Interfaces will enable quicker receipt/transmission of information from/to the cyber domain.  HPO offers a potential for future Soldiers to analyze and process information and exercise judgment with levels of maturity beyond their current age and experience, achieving outcomes faster, replicating capabilities of today's Soldiers in elite units at an earlier age.  While the US leads global investment in biomedical-technology, trends indicate this lead is at risk.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">WAY AHEAD</p>
<p>Focused S&T efforts and increased modernization priorities for accelerated information to decisions, advanced materials, and HPO appear to provide the best opportunities to improve Army strategic, operational, and tactical agility, enhance discriminant lethality, improve force protection and rebalance the Army's tooth-to-tail to meet the emerging challenges of 2025 and beyond.  Other areas that must be focused lines of effort for S&T and modernization priority include robotics, mobile protected platform, improved lethality, logistics optimization and aviation.</p>
<p>Current levels of national, defense, and Army investment in these areas are not consistent with previous successful examples of focused science and technology investment.  This effort requires coordinated action between the Army, scientists, doctors, engineers, and industry to maintain our competitive advantage on tomorrow's battlefield.  When mass was king, the nation could mobilize and deploy our way to success, but rapidly emerging trends make this paradigm obsolete.  National investment and innovation are necessary today to ensure the Army of 2025 and beyond continues to assure national security, at the speed of change.</p>
