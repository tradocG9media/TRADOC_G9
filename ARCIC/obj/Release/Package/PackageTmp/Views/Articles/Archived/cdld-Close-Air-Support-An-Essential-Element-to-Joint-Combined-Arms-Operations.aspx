<p>Close Air Support (CAS) is defined as "air action by fixed or rotary wing aircraft against hostile targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces and that require detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those force."<span class="endnoteRef">[1]</span>  From the first bombs dropped by hand on World War I trenches to Reaper strikes directed by troops in contact in Afghanistan, air assets have provided lifesaving and mission essential close air support to ground forces. Airpower in general and close air support in particular was essential to restoring mobility to the modern battlefield after World War I and has remained critical to retaining freedom of movement and action on land.  Not only does close air support provide physical advantages to friendly forces, it also provides them with the psychological advantage of knowing that, upon contact with elusive and capable enemies, airpower will pose enemy forces with multiple dilemmas and force them to respond to multiple forms of contact.</p>
<div class="blockCallout" id="alignLt">
			<div class="blockquote"><strong>Joint combined arms operations:</strong><br />Synchronized, simultaneous, or sequential application of two or more arms or elements of one service, along with joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to ensure unity of effort and create multiple dilemmas for the enemy.</div>
			</div>
<p>CAS is effective against enemy forces when ground maneuver units, airpower, and fires are employed simultaneously and in a synchronized manner to defeat enemy organizations, retain terrain, and exploit opportunities. As future adversaries evolve technologies and tactics to negate U.S. advantages, effective air-ground operations and close air support will become even more important to seizing, retaining, and exploiting the initiative in battle.  Current practice separates air-ground operations into three overlapping components: Army aviation, close air support, and air interdiction. The integration of all elements of air-ground operations into a single joint sphere represents an opportunity to improve Army and Air Force capabilities to operate in and project power across the five domains of air, land, maritime, space, and cyberspace. Effective air-ground operations are built on relationships, common understanding, and mutual trust that enhance the planning, coordination, and synchronized employment of combat power to achieve the commander's objectives.<span class="endnoteRef">[2]</span>  To retain the critical differential advantage that CAS provides the Joint Force and improve the Joint Force's ability to conduct air-ground operations against increasingly capable enemies, the Army and Air Force must develop common mission command and network communications, improve training, establish habitual relationships through force alignment, and integrate air-ground operations planning.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Why is close air support important?</p>
<p>Since World War II, the success of U.S. military forces depended, in large measure, on the synergistic effects of capable land and air forces<span class="endnoteRef">[3]</span>.  During Operation DESERT STORM, Coalition air and ground forces faced an enemy that was identifiable and concentrated.  U.S. air supremacy permitted an extensive air interdiction campaign that caused attrition of enemy forces, blocked lines of communications, and allowed US ground forces to retain the initiative unchallenged by enemy counteraction<span class="endnoteRef">[4]</span> in what the Gulf War Airpower Study described as "one of the most one-sided campaigns in military history."<span class="endnoteRef">[5]</span>  Since the Gulf War, enemies and adversaries learned from the Iraqi Army's fundamental mistake to fight the U.S. Joint Force symmetrically.  Enemies, and adversaries are becoming increasingly capable and elusive. US experience in Afghanistan since 2001 and Iraq since 2003 as well as Israel's recent experiences in Southern Lebanon and Gaza highlight the need for the close integration of air and ground efforts to cope with enemy countermeasures.   Those countermeasures include technologies such as sophisticated air defenses and GPS jamming as well as tactical countermeasures such as dispersion, concealment, deception, and intermingling with civilian populations.  To overcome those and other countermeasures, the Army will depend on the U.S. Air Force to conduct close air support in the context of Air Ground Operations and Joint Combined Arms Operations.  Joint Combined Arms Operations will pose enemies with multiple dilemmas, avoid enemy strengths, attack weakness, and allow air-ground forces to maneuver to positions of relative advantage.</p>
<div class="blockCallout" id="alignRt">

			</div>
<p>As U.S. ground forces operate dispersed and in restrictive and urban terrain, CAS will prove essential to reducing risk to those forces as well as preserving their freedom of maneuver and action in close contact with the enemy.  Enemy countermeasures in urban and restrictive terrain will degrade the Joint Force's ability to target the enemy with standoff capabilities.  Effective close air support against elusive and capable enemies will depend on aircraft performance and munitions capabilities as well as ground forces' ability to accurately locate targets.  Effective air ground operations will also depend on developing common mission command and network communications, improving training, establishing habitual relationships through force alignment, and integrating air-ground planning.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Implications and Recommendations</p>
<p><strong>Develop common mission command and network communications:</strong><br />To operate dispersed against a range of threats, the Army must enable tactical formations to respond rapidly, through mission command, to changes in their operational area. Joint combined arms air-ground teams operate across all domains by identifying enemy locations, moving to positions of relative advantage, engaging the enemy under favorable conditions, and simultaneously presenting multiple dilemmas to the enemy. Future air-ground operations require a near-real time capability to integrate fires with ground maneuver, and to clear and manage airspace simultaneously across all domains to identify, prioritize, and attack targets down to the tactical level. Army and Air Force communications systems must enable tactical ground units to pass targeting information and conduct terminal aircraft control. Pilots must be able to instantly share information, confirm targets, and pass damage assessments to ground forces.</p>
<p><strong>Improve training:</strong><br />Effective air-ground operations begin with a mutual understanding of the capabilities and limitations of air and ground capabilities. While this understanding begins in service schools, mastering air-ground integration requires consistent and continuous experience. Joint education programs provide the theoretical understanding required to integrate the air-ground team and are reinforced through a combination of live, virtual, and constructive training programs at home station and combat training centers. Achieving a mutual understanding of air and ground asset capabilities and limitations enhances combat effectiveness while reducing risk to friendly forces and local populations. Under the stress of combat, only cohesive teams which have trained together can overcome the inherent frictions of active operations.</p>
<p><strong>Establish habitual relationships through force alignment:</strong><br />Even with perfect communications and improvements in training, effective air-ground operations require cohesive teams built upon habitual relationships and the associated opportunity to improve air-ground operations capabilities in a sustained manner. Developing an appreciation for how each part of the air-ground team operates allows the development of trust between commanders and subordinates and between the Services. This trust becomes the backbone of operating under commander's intent and allows leaders to accept prudent risk to exploit opportunities or to respond to unforeseen challenges. Developing these cohesive teams begins during service and joint professional military education, is reinforced in joint training events, and is solidified through cross-service personnel assignment opportunities for noncommissioned, warrant, and commissioned officers.  Through force alignment, air and ground formations establish habitual relationships and conduct rehearsals together before entering a joint operations area.</p>
<p><strong>Integrate air-ground operations planning:</strong><br />Delivering CAS in the context of air-ground and joint combined arms operations requires collaboration during the operations process, refinement during rehearsals, and effective coordination during execution.  The nexus of CAS is at the tactical formation while in close contact with the enemy; therefore, planning for CAS should begin in those formations. The current joint operational planning and air allocation planning models remain separated and do not adequately include tactical-level commanders.  Battalion and brigade commanders have the greatest situational understanding, yet do not currently have the ability to plan for the employment of CAS.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Conclusion</p>
<p>Improved close air support is fundamental to the effective execution of joint combined arms operations.  Enemies are becoming increasingly capable and elusive.  To stay ahead of enemy countermeasures to U.S. strengths, the Army and Air Force must improve upon the delivery of CAS in the context of air-ground and joint combined arms operations.  As history has shown, effective close air support loiters overhead during sustained operations, delivers time-sensitive information to identify enemy locations, and delivers critical ordnance to the point of need for ground force commanders.  To seize, retain, and exploit the initiative over future enemies, the Army and Air Force must improve CAS capabilities by developing common mission command and network communications, improving training, establishing habitual relationships through force alignment, and integrating air-ground operations planning.</p>
