            <h3><strong>Army Host Largest-Ever, Joint-Combined Network Exercise</strong></h3>
            <p><i>By: David Vergun, Army.mil, September 24, 2015</i></p>

            <br />
            <p>
                FORT BLISS, Texas (Army News Service, Sept. 24, 2015) -- The Network Integration Evaluation, or NIE 16.1, which takes place Sept. 25 through Oct. 8, will be the largest NIE ever, since the exercises started in 2011, said Brig. Gen. Terry McKenrick.
Normally, there are between 3,500 and 3,800 participants in NIE, said McKenrick, who is the commanding general, Brigade Modernization Command. NIE 16.1 has more than 9,000 U.S. and coalition soldiers, supported by more than 3,000 civilians participating primarily at Fort Bliss, but also other locations around the U.S. and the world.
            </p>
            <p>Among the many Army units participating this time are I Corps Headquarters; 1st Armored Division Headquarter, along with several 1st Armored Division brigades; a brigade headquarters from the United Kingdom, along with a company of Strykers being used by the United Kingdom's Scots Guards; 82nd Airborne Division, which will conduct a joint forcible entry; and, 101st Airborne Division, which will conduct an airborne assault.</p>
            <p>
                The U.K. and Italy join U.S. units on the ground with 12 other nations, as well as other U.S. military units, some of which will participate virtually, using a variety of simulations.
Some 300 platforms, including just about all the vehicles in the Army's inventory, as well as experimental vehicles, loaded with a of radios, satellite communications gear and mission command applications, are being evaluated, along with radios carried by dismounted Soldiers, McKenrick said. 
NIE 16.1 is assessing manned and unmanned teaming -- the ability to increase situational understanding, lethality, and sustainment of maneuver forces while reducing manpower and risk, he said. In all, three unmanned ground systems are being evaluated, as well as several networked unmanned air systems. 
            </p>
            <p>Network provides the ability for Soldiers in command posts, mounted and dismounted to download situational awareness data from the unmanned air systems. </p>
            
            <div>
              <h3>COMBAT TRAINING CENTER-EQUIVALENT TRAINING</h3>
                
                <p>While NIE 16.1 is about experimentation, an equally valuable focus will be on readiness, McKenrick said. The realistic training will be equivalent to a combat training center rotation, with a hybrid threat featuring combined-arms maneuver and wide-area security against an opposing force. Weapons of mass destruction scenarios will also be incorporated.</p>
                <p>McKenrick said the Army is now going through an "assessment process" of accrediting White Sands-Bliss-Holloman as a "joint-multinational training capability. That will help us bring in more joint and multinational partners in future exercises."</p>
                <p>Now and in the future, the Army will operate as part of a joint and coalition force, he said. It's spelled out in the Army's keystone doctrine known as the "Army Operating Concept: Win in a Complex World." To do that effectively requires compatibility across network architectures that each of the armies use, he said. That's why this exercise and getting it right is so important to the U.S. and its partner nations.</p>
                <p>Besides Fort Bliss, the exercise will also spill over to adjacent Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range, both in New Mexico. To give sense of scale, White Sands is 3,200 square miles, Fort Bliss 1,700, while the entire state of Rhode Island is a mere 1,214.</p>
