            <p>
                This fall marked the Army’s 10th Network Integration Evaluation, a semiannual event created and conducted
                by the Army’s Brigade Modernization Command; Test and Evaluation Command; and System of Systems, Engineering and Integration Command. Far more
                significant than the 10-event milestone was the overlapping final proof of concept for a new annual Army field event. Designated
                the Army Warfighting Assessment, this new event is built on a foundation provided by those 10 preceding Network
                Integration Evaluations. Beginning in 2011, Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs) feature expansive field exercises conducted by the Army’s 2nd
                Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, with additional support elements at Fort Bliss, Texas, and White Sands Missile Range, N.M.

            </p>
            <p>
                Those involved with the NIEs credit the events with achieving
two major goals: the refinement, integration and validation
of the Army’s tactical network concept; and providing a formal
venue to perform programmatic tests on new Army materiel
related to that network. NIEs have also contributed to informing
and educating the Army regarding brigade combat teams
and how soldiers and leaders actually use the network.
Additionally, the Department of the Army G-8 has estimated
that NIEs have saved $6 billion in “cost avoidance”
through program restructures or termination. In terms of direct
warfighter benefits, since 2013 the integrated network capabilities
that emerged from the NIE process have been
fielded to dozens of units in the 82nd Airborne, 101st Air-
borne (Air Assault), 1st Armored, 1st Cavalry, 10th Mountain
and 25th Infantry divisions.
            </p>
            <div class="thumbnail with-caption pull-left textWrap col-md-4">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../app_Imgs-Content/_nie-7.jpg" />
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            <p>
                But after 10 of those massive events and all of that fielding,
some—including Army leadership—wondered just how much
value NIEs were providing. In 2014, the Army was directed to
look at the NIE construct to determine what levels of benefit
it was offering to the Army and the nation.
Part of the Army analysis focused on whether two NIEs are
required each year to conduct the critical programmatic testing
and continue to get doctrinal feedback from the brigade combat
teams. The decision was that they probably weren’t, in part
because many of the major programs had already completed
their formal developmental testing and were in production.
Moreover, much of the integration work on these systems was
also completed.

            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, the Army opted to continue just one NIE per
year, specifically using it to continue network integration as
new capabilities come online and to test related programs of
record. Those continuing NIEs will generally take place at
Fort Bliss and White Sands each spring.

                <h3>Enter AWA</h3>
                <p>
                    The second decision emerging from the Army analysis was
that as the service prepares to look at possible force structure
changes as well as how the Army will operate with coalition
and joint service partners, an “experimentation event” was also
needed. That led to creation of the Army Warfighting Assessment
(AWA).
                </p>
                <div class="thumbnail with-caption pull-left textWrap col-md-5">

                </div>
                <p>
                    In late September and early October, the Army used the previously scheduled NIE 16.1 to establish the foundation for the AWA. While historic NIEs generally put about
3,500 to 3,800 soldiers in the field, the transitional NIE 16.1/AWA combination featured participation by more than 9,000 soldiers from all over the country,
direct international participation by the U.K. and Italy, and “virtual” participation by another dozen countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key elements of the combined NIE
16.1/AWA included coalition networking,
exploring the initial steps of integrating
with coalition partners to share
information, and other explorations related
to 80 different prototype “industry
solutions” that were deployed to potentially
inform future requirements.

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        “This is the first time we have set up a
coalition network to assess our joint interoperability
among all those multinational
partners,” said Brig. Gen. Terry
McKenrick, commanding general of
Brigade Modernization Command. “It’s
a very dynamic exercise, and the largest
operational exercise that the Army will
conduct this year.”
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Reiterating and emphasizing the differences
between that NIE process and
AWA, he described the new events as
exercises “to help test ideas.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    AWAs will allow “our industry, government
centers of excellence, and joint
and multinational partners to bring concepts
and capabilities—including some
that were not part of our Mission Command
network—into an integrated exercise,
assess them, and receive good feedback
for prototype systems that have not
been seen before but are run through the
same rigorous environment created
here,” he said.
                </p>
                <div class="thumbnail with-caption pull-left textWrap col-md-3">

                </div>
                <p>
                    The result will help streamline any future
acquisition process surrounding
those prototypes or capabilities, he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the overlap between
NIE 16.1 and the final proof of concept
for AWA, the recent event incorporated
the latest iteration of a multinational interoperability
event, sponsored by the
Joint Staff J-6, dubbed Bold Quest 15.2.

                <h3>In The Field</h3>
                 <div class="thumbnail with-caption pull-left textWrap col-md-5">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../app_Imgs-Content/_nie-9.jpg" />
                    <p></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Out in the field, Col. Charles Masaracchia
recently welcomed visitors to
Tactical Assembly Area Salerno at Fort
Bliss where the headquarters of his 2nd
Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st
Armored Division, was preparing to
move further into the tactical scenarios
of AWA/NIE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this event, the brigade was configured
as a hybrid task force organization in
which the standard armored brigade combat
team was equipped with additional elements
such as a Stryker battalion and an
air assault battalion. Other attachments
included a company of National Guard
engineers, a route clearance platoon and
an air defense artillery platoon. A company
of U.K. Scots Guards was integrated
into the Stryker battalion and
participated in the AWA while simultaneously
exploring potential D.K. interest
in a medium-weight wheeled armored platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Masaracchia led visitors into the Tactical Operations Control
Center. A large, central tent area represented “all warfighting
functions.” Characterizing it as “where all of the Mission
Command for the brigade originates,” he highlighted functional
areas related to elements including fires, air defense artillery,
intelligence and chemical defense while pointing out
battle captains, battle NCOs and various liaison staff elements.
He emphasized the differences between the AWA and earlier
NIE events that involved systems under test and systems
under evaluation. “We are not testing any new capabilities
during this rotation. We are evaluating, and we are doing
what we call a demo of new emerging technologies. And
through that, we will help and assist in the writing of new
doctrine for how those technologies may be employed,”
Masaracchia said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He noted that AWA/NIE included some new technologies
such as “technology surrogates,” which he described as “new
technology that is coming out that is not the exact piece of
equipment but represents a surrogate to it, so that we can try
to figure out the doctrine of how to fight it and provide the
command and control to it.”
                </p>

                    Current Army plans call for the first official AWA, designated
AWA 17, to be conducted from September-October
2016. A recent concept development conference for that
event, which included input from joint and multinational
partners, resulted in a list of 38 new concepts and capabilities
that will be integrated into the event. McKenrick also said
AWA 17 might feature a different
coalition feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Where this year’s exercise was
focused on our NATO partners
in [U.S. European Command],
next year will be focused on our
Pacific partners” in U.S. Pacific
Command. The event will also
expand focus on concepts and capabilities
like expeditionary command
posts, a coalition network
focused on Pacific partners, and
better integration of special operations
and coalition forces.
