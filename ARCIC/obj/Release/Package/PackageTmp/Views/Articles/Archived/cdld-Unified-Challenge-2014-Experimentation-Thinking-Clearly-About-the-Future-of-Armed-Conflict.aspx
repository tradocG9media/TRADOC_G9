<p>The future operating environments in which the United States Army will operate pose complex challenges due to the rapidly evolving nature of armed conflict.  To win in these environments, the Army conducts experimentation campaigns to think clearly about these challenges and determine the requirements to support future concepts and capabilities development efforts.</p>
<p>The UNIFIED CHALLENGE 2014 Experiment campaign provided valuable insights that will inform the Army's transition to Force 2025 and Beyond.  Army experimentation provides a unique, cost effective venue with which to examine the interplay of new concepts, such as the Army Operating Concept and the supporting Functional Concepts against a variety of threats.  UNIFIED CHALLENGE 2014 experiments provided a robust examination of the new Army Operating Concept over three major events. The experiments informed the development of supporting functional concepts and assessed the Army's capability to conduct joint and inter-organizational operations promptly, with sufficient scale and duration to prevent, shape, and win future conflicts.<span class="endnoteRef">[1]</span></p>
<p>These experiments, as part of an integrated futures development effort, resulted in insights on how smaller, more lethal, expeditionary, and agile Army forces maintain greater combat effectiveness against potential adversaries while conducting joint combined arms air-ground operations.</p>
<p>In a complex world, the Army must continue to develop new concepts and capabilities to maintain pace with the increased velocity and momentum of human interaction and events.<span class="endnoteRef">[2]</span>  Army experimentation provides a cost effective way to explore future concepts and capabilities. The Army Capabilities Integration Center's (ARCIC) Joint and Army Experimentation Division (JAED) leads this program in conjunction with battle laboratories from the Centers of Excellence. Experimentation uses different types of wargames, ranging from tabletop roundtable discussions to simulation-based events utilizing hundreds of personnel replicating Brigade to Corps staffs in order to address the pressing questions the Army must answer.</p>
<p>Realistic, future based scenarios enable experimenters to fight concepts and capabilities to assess combat effectiveness against a thinking, adaptive threat, in an uncertain environment, within a whole of government context.  With the uncertainty posed by the future, experimentation provides a critical venue to examine future concepts and capabilities, just as the UNIFIED CHALLENGE 2014 experiments informed the development of the Army functional concepts and evaluated the potential performance of emerging science and technology enablers.</p>
<p>Two distinct scenarios and experiment types enabled JAED and the Center of Excellence Battle Laboratories to examine operations across the range of military operations.  The first UNIFIED CHALLENGE scenario, set in Africa, provided an environment with which to examine interactions with joint, inter-organizational and multinational partners. This allowed experimenters to address the Army's ability to conduct humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.  These experiments utilized a formally adjudicated, multisided game-based experiment (GAMEXp) model that emphasized qualitative assessments and examined the interactions of military forces in response to a short notice crisis.  The GAMEXp model enabled the examination of concepts and required capabilities at the organizational level, and provided the ability to think through the long term effects of operations on both the force and the operating environment.  The Mission Command Battle Lab led the two experiments examining this scenario during June and July of 2014 and leveraged multiple subject matter experts from multinational partners, other U.S. federal departments, academia, and the private sector to provide a holistic examination of the Army's ability to execute successful whole of government response to a crisis.</p>
<p>The second UNIFIED CHALLENGE scenario focused on major combat operations against a regional adversary in 2025.  This experiment examined the detailed interactions within a Corps while conducting joint combined arms air-ground operations and led by the Fires Battle Lab during September of 2014.  Instead of a game-based model, this experiment used a simulation based experiment model (SIMEXp) to enable the assessment of concepts and required capabilities to entity level.  The SIMXEp enables friendly, neutral/civilian and opposing forces to interact in real time in a simulated environment to examine the interactions between staffs and commanders from Brigade to Corps echelons, and provide quantifiable data and observations on the performance of new capabilities.</p>
<p>These experiments yielded several significant insights, which identified concept and capability gaps when operating in an austere environment.  The Army Operating Concept core competencies of set the theater, project national power, and wide area security received a thorough examination.<span class="endnoteRef">[3]</span>  The two game-based experiments determined a smaller Army remains capable of conducting stability operations in austere environments, although with greater risk to the Army's ability to both engage regionally and respond globally.<span class="endnoteRef">[4]</span>  The SIMEXp provided critical insights that informed the development of the Army's Warfighting Challenges and functional concepts, exploring how the Army maintains combat effectiveness and overmatch while conducting joint combined arms air-ground operations.</p>
<p>All three major experiments examined the ability of science and technology enablers to provide Soldiers with the same or increased combat effectiveness to maintain superiority over projected adversaries.  In coordination with ARCIC's Science and Technology (S&T) Division, the experimentation community of practice examined 48 different S&T enablers, including those from the Army's top 25 S&T enabler list.</p>

<p>Overall, these S&T enablers performed well and provided the future force with tangible and important combat capabilities.  Some, such as the Cargo UAS (see image 1) provided the Army with the ability to examine nascent existing capabilities and determine best concepts for employment to increase sustainment efficiency.  Others, such as the Army High Energy Laser (HEL) Mobile Demonstrator (see image 2), provided increased protection against enemy rockets, mortars, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles.  The requirements to maintain and utilize these enablers at BCT level and below potentially increases the physical and cognitive demands on Soldiers, but these additional demands did not outweigh the benefits and overmatch capabilities of these emerging technologies.<span class="endnoteRef">[5]</span></p>

<p>UNIFIED CHALLENGE 2014 directly informed pressing Army problems and conceptual gaps, while providing a venue to inform the development of the new Army functional concepts.  As Gen. David G. Perkins, U.S. Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) Commanding General, states in the preface to the Army Operating Concept, every Army professional should "think clearly about the problem of future armed conflict."<span class="endnoteRef">[6]</span>  Experimentation seeks to address this problem by asking the fundamental questions concerning the feasibility of future concepts and capabilities to enable the Army to continue to prevent, shape, and win against a variety of future threats across the spectrum of conflict.</p>
<p>The results and procedural lessons learned from 2014 experimentation informs Army and Centers of Excellence efforts in 2015, beginning with the UNIFIED CHALLENGE 15.1 Seminar Wargame occurring from March 16-27 at the Mission Command Battle Lab at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.</p>
