As such, the ACC describes the characteristics of the future Army and its initiative to transition the Army from one focused on winning two wars, to an expeditionary Army that does many things well. The ACC establishes the foundation for subordinate concepts that will describe how the future Army must fight and identify the required warfighting capabilities essential to ensuring combat effectiveness against the full spectrum of threats the Nation is likely to confront in the future. The ACC is fully nested in the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations: Joint Force 2020 (CCJO).</p>

Competition for wealth, resources, political authority, sovereignty, and legitimacy will produce a variety of conflicts between rapidly evolving and adaptive threats in an increasingly competitive but interconnected world. Furthermore, the distinctions between threats will blur in the future due to the complexity of adversaries, the multiplicity of actors involved, and the ability of threats to adapt rapidly.
