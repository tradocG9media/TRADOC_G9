      <title>Gen Perkins on Multi-Domain Battle: Joint Combined Arms Concept For the 21st Century</title>
      <author></author>
      <description>
        "During most of our recent history, the only domain that has been truly
        contested has been the land domain. The joint force has enjoyed an
        unprecedented level of freedom of action in the air, space, maritime and
        cyber domains. This will not be the case in the future. Contemporary and
        emerging threats seek to gain control of contested spaces not only in the
        air and on land but at sea, in space and cyberspace as well as the
        electromagnetic spectrum and the cognitive dimension of human perception."
        (GEN Perkins, TRADOC Commander)

      <title>For the U.S. Army, It’s Not About the Story</title>
      <author>Nadia Schadlow</author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[    
                    
            <article>
							 <p>Recently, the new Army Secretary Eric Fanning repeated what by now is a familiar refrain in defense policy circles: The Army must tell its story better in order to get the resources it needs.  The “tell the story better” narrative is by now a familiar one — and a misguided one.</p>
							 <p>The fundamental problem is not the quality of the Army story; the problem is a fundamental disagreement about what current and future warfare entails. It is a disagreement over how to design military forces to achieve desired strategic and political outcomes within resource constraints and trade-offs. It is a disagreement over the theory of warfare held by the Army on the one hand, and the theory of warfare held by a large number of policy analysts on the other — including much of today’s civilian political leadership.</p>
							 <p>As a recent article by Army Major Robert Chamberlain points out, a theory of warfare is a description of how a military intends to produce strategic outcomes. A theory of warfare guides the kind of force that you need to grow and field to produce a desired strategic outcome. Army senior leaders have expressed how they believe the Army will likely fight now and in the future. The purpose of this brief article is  not to capture this theory fully, but rather to point out that the Army has told its story of how near- and medium-term wars are likely to be fought, and the service has argued for an endstrength and force modernization program based on this view. What parts of the Army story are critics rejecting and why? That should be the focus of the discussion.</p>
							 <p>The Army view is that conflicts in the future, like those in the past, will ultimately be resolved on land. Army forces will be essential components of joint operations to create sustainable political outcomes while defeating enemies and adversaries who challenge U.S. advantages in all domains: land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace. Army contributions to joint operations provide multiple options to civilian and military leaders. These capabilities include tailorable and scalable combinations of special operations and conventional forces, regionally aligned and globally responsive combined arms teams, and foundational theater capabilities to enable joint operations.</p>
							 <p>Land-based threats emanate from the fielded forces of hostile nation states and from areas where state weakness allows non-state enemy or adversary organizations to operate. Conflict often arises from disorder, and land forces are needed to overcome the effects of this disorder. Although the ability to project power onto land from the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains will remain vital to joint operations, the employment of land forces will remain essential to achieve political outcomes.</p>
							 <p>Army leaders have made the case that the continuities in the character of war are just as important as any changes in warfare. As Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley explained, wars are ultimately decided on the ground. Because the desire for control over territory, populations, and resources is a frequent cause of war — witness the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  today — the Army’s ability to deny enemy control of the land domain is fundamental to prevailing in armed conflict. The ability to control territory remains a critical function of the Army, and arguments about Army end strength are linked to assumptions about this fundamental characteristic of warfare.</p>
							 <p>Moreover, because territory matters, the ability to consolidate gains matters as well. The Army’s theory of warfare argues that forces must be able to compel outcomes without the cooperation of the enemy and that achieving sustainable political outcomes will require the consolidation of combat gains through the establishment of stable environments. Consistent with this view of warfare, the Army has rejected idea that wars of the future will necessarily be short. “Wars are funny things. They have a logic all of their own. And they rarely conform to preplanned timelines,” Milley has said.</p>
							 <p>Since the environment will remain unpredictable, the Army theory of warfare holds that its forces must be able to fight and prevail along the full spectrum of conflict, from stability operations to high-intensity conventional conflict. Army former   Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence Gen. Mary Legere has explained that in today’s complex security environment, the Army does not have the luxury of a single opponent or threat and must be prepared to respond to all adversaries. Milley has explained that the Army must sustain the counterterrorist and counterinsurgency capabilities that it developed over the past 15 years “while simultaneously rebuilding the capability to win in ground combat against higher-end threats such as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.” The National Commission on the Future of the Army backed up the view that demands for Army forces are increasing.</p>
							 <p>To achieve the ability to fight across the spectrum of conflict and respond quickly to contingencies, Army leaders have consistently argued for protecting readiness and for linking readiness and end strength to deterrence, since “you can only deter your opponent if your opponent believes that you have the will and the capability.” Deterrence depends upon the ability to deny the enemy the ability to accomplish its objectives. Some senior Army leaders such as Gen. Ben Hodges would prefer forward-stationed units (such as brigade combat teams in Europe), a smaller Army and political decisions outside of their control preclude this in the near term. Army leaders have expressed skepticism that wars can be won with advanced technologies, arguing that “after the shock and awe comes the march and fight.” They likewise believe that combat vehicles will continue to play a central role in warfare, providing soldiers with mobility, lethality, and protection to defeat enemy forces and/or seize, occupy, and defend land areas. The operational environment is not going to be static, and Army forces must be prepared to transition rapidly between major combat, military-to-military engagement, and humanitarian assistance. The Army will need to continuously combine offensive, defensive, and stability operations through a blend of combined arms maneuver and wide-area security (which includes counterinsurgency).</p>
							 <p>Gen. Milley and other leaders have made the case that prevailing in war takes more than killing high-value terrorists with drone strikes and small-unit raids, and that special forces cannot do it all. Nor can a small Army simply grow when needed. Milley has also pointed out that if the Army becomes too small, the nation cannot simply recruit more people, put them through basic training, and “presto,” have a unit. Soldiers take years to develop the competencies and skills necessary to wage modern ground combat.</p>
							 <p>Under the guise of “tell a better story,” defense leaders are talking past each other and avoiding the tough conversations they should be having. Secretary of the Army Fanning should engage critics over the specific aspects of the kinds of war they believe are most likely to unfold, since there are implicit and unchallenged assumptions that underpin the views of those who claim that the Army needs to do better at telling the story. Should the United States reconsider its position on forward presence in Europe?  How important is the Army for providing a robust deterrent to America’s adversaries? And perhaps most importantly, will the ability to control territory from the land remain fundamental to warfare in the future?</p>

      <title>No Safe Place In Next War: The Army’s Expanded Battlefield</title>
      <author>Sydney J. Freedberg, Jr</author>
      <description>
        What if the next war starts, not with a gunshot, but with a tweet? As tensions rise, US troops discover their families’ names, faces, and home addresses have been posted on social media as they prepare to deploy, along with exhortations to kill the fascists/imperialists/infidels (pick one). Trolls call them late at night with death threats, a mentally ill lone wolf runs over a soldier’s children, fake news claims the military is covering up more deaths, and official social media accounts are hacked to post falsehoods. The whole force is distracted and demoralized.

             <p>WASHINGTON -- Serving as "test drives" for possible Army systems of the future, prototypes are playing an increasingly vital role as a natural bridge between emerging technologies and more mature solutions that are part of official programs of record.</p>    
        <p>While prototypes are not perfect solutions, they are an essential interim step that deliver initial capabilities to select units who can provide early and frequent feedback, so that the technology can be improved over time or scrapped before significant investments are made. </p>

      <title>US Army Tests Out New ‘Hunter,’ ‘Killer’ Multi-Domain Dune Buggies</title>
      <author>Tactical Life</author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[    
				<p> 
        The U.S. Army recently tested a pair of new vehicles as part of its multi-domain battle concept at the 2017 Maneuver Fires Integrated Experiment in Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Dubbed the “Hunter” and “Killer” and built for various types of terrain, these vehicles look like dune buggies, but in reality they’re capable of much more. For example, the Hunter platform would call precision fires in an automated fashion on land. For the air, soldiers could use the platform to communicate with aircraft for support. It also has maritime capability, in the sense that a forward observer could call for an attack from a ship to a target.

      <title>The Army Needs to Speed Up Efforts to Close Critical Capability Gaps</title>
      <author>Dan Goure</author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[    
				<p> 
        Over the past year the U.S. Army has been conducting a Strategic Portfolio Analysis Review (SPAR) of its 780 weapons and equipment programs. Championed by Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley, the key requirement of the SPAR is to identify modernization priorities that must be pursued in order to maintain and eventually regain overmatch to credibly deter and defeat near-peer adversaries. Based on the SPAR’s identification of critical capability gaps, the Army’s leadership will decide which programs require immediate attention and resources and which programs can be slowed down or de-scoped to extract resources to be placed against higher priority needs. It is apparent that the first Trump defense budget will not provide the Army with significant additional funds to modernize a rapidly aging force.  Hence, it must rebalance its modernization portfolio to ensure that high priority programs receive the necessary resources and support.

				<p> FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. (Army News Service) -- Swarms of robots scouring enemy terrain ahead of ground troops outfitted in high-tech exoskeleton suits are among the many ideas proposed in the Army's new strategy on robotic and autonomous systems.</p>
        <p>In the not too distant future, Army leaders believe, war will be far more complex, calling upon Soldiers to engage enemies in multiple domains simultaneously. The 30-page strategy, which was released Wednesday, outlines five objectives to guide the technology that will ensure those Soldiers can survive and succeed in such an environment.</p>

        ROSE BARRACKS, Germany – Low, slow and small is the target of the latest U.S. Army capability, the Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS) Mobile Integrated Capability, or CMIC, to touch down in Germany this month.

“The U.S. Army has witnessed drones as a threat in theatre,” said Maj. David C. Andrews, Fires Center of Excellence, C-UAS mobile capability lead. “Our enemies are adapting, and this capability is the leading system to detect and defeat that threat.”

As a System of Systems, the CMIC is a mounted non-kinetic capability that combines Electronic Warfare (EW), radar and optic capabilities to detect, identify and defeat UAS threats.

        <![CDATA[    
				<p> 
       ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND (January 27, 2017) – Army engineers recently demonstrated network technology that will allow commanders to conduct mission command using multiple computing devices from brigade down to the edge.

The Tactical Computing Environment, or TCE, developed by the U.S. Army Materiel Command’s Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, or CERDEC, supports the Army’s Force 2025 and Beyond strategy, which provides the nation with a more expeditionary and agile force.

“The military’s large, fixed ‘TOC Mahals’ have given way to smaller, more mobile command posts in an effort to support the Army’s push for expeditionary mission command,” said Cynthia Carpenter, CERDEC Command, Power, and Integration, or CP&I, data engineering chief. “The TCE provides untethered commanders with the same or better capabilities than they had with their stationary command post networked mission command systems.”

      <title>Force 2025 and Beyond: TRADOC commander shares insight</title>
      <author> Spc. Anthony Bryant</author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[    
				<p> 
       Gen. David G. Perkins spoke to brigade command leadership about the current military environment and how the Army is adapting operational strategy in line with the protocols established in Force 2025 and Beyond due to the rapidly changing global security landscape that is volatile, unstable and increasingly threatening to U.S. interests.
Force 2025 and Beyond is the comprehensive strategy to define the future operating environment to ensure the Army is prepared to accomplish future missions and identify key trends to predict that environment.
One identified trend is the capacity of adversaries to emulate U.S. military capabilities, said Perkins. During the Cold War, the asymmetric advantage of U.S. forces was technical capability. However, that gap in technology is becoming less and less pronounced as U.S. military technologies are replicated by adversarial armies. What can be predicted going forward, is that if the U.S. acquires a new capability, it’s only a matter of time before somebody else gets it.
“When I was growing up in the Army on the inter-German border as a lieutenant during the Cold War, we had all kinds of capabilities (the enemy) didn’t have,” said Perkins. “We had night vision goggles; they didn’t have them. We had thermal sights; they didn’t have them. We were differentiated from our enemy by the capabilities they didn’t have.”
Another key trend Perkins discussed was the increasing rate of change across the spectrum, and the necessity to innovate to handle battlefields in flux. As the TRADOC commander, Perkins is designated the lead and responsible official for Force 2025 and Beyond.

        <![CDATA[    
				<p> It is still said, over 70 years later, that much of the success of the U.S. Navy in WWII was due to iterative learning through continual examination of a war in the Pacific through gaming. Despite that immense success, wargaming has fallen out of favor in some defense circles. This article intends to reenergize the discussion on the utility of wargaming.</p>

				<p>Times change. The world evolves. Leadership transitions. Great organizations adapt. Such is the case with our U.S. Army. To address new threats and the security environment around the globe in support of the National Military Strategy, our Army leadership set priorities and aligned operations, shifting to the Sustainable Readiness Model and Multi-Domain Battle concept.</p>
				<p>The U.S. Army Materiel Command, the Army’s materiel integrator, is adapting alongside it, fully nested with the chief of staff of the Army’s priorities. In conjunction with the U.S. Army Forces Command and the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Materiel Command rounds out the triad that ensures the Army remains the best-staffed, best-trained and best-equipped fighting force in the world.</p>

      <title>McMaster's departure accelerates replacement time line </title>
      <author>Courtney McBride</author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[    
				<p> By Courtney McBride, <span class="small"> INSIDE DEFENSE</span> </p>
                <p>The appointment of Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster to serve as President Trump's national security adviser has created a vacancy at the top of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, which is charged with defining the Army of the future.</p> 
				<p>In his capacity as ARCIC director, McMaster has championed modernization of the Army's combat vehicle fleet, repeatedly challenging arguments about cost by emphasizing the critical need of a capable maneuver force.</p>
			<p>In December, he highlighted the array of problems facing the service: "the Army's too small, the Army got too light . . . the Army was out of position . . . [and] we were out of date; we were not modernized." In order "to reduce risk to the mission and to the force in the future," he said, the Army has to address all of these issues.</p>
			<p>While advocating for new capabilities, as codified in ARCIC's "Big 6+1" effort, McMaster also pushed for the Army to gain additional capability from existing equipment, highlighting directed energy, cyber and electronic warfare as avenues for such efforts. He touted the "Russian new-generation warfare study" as helping to direct and focus Army modernization efforts to combat potential threats from a high-end adversary.</p>
			<p>The work continues at his former command.The work continues at his former command.</p>
			<p>Maj. Thomas Campbell, a TRADOC spokesman, told Inside the Army: "TRADOC and ARCIC were of course proud of Lt. Gen. McMaster's appointment as the national security adviser."</p>
			<p>McMaster assumed the post of ARCIC director in July 2014. In that time, Campbell said, "his impact on the organization in helping to develop the future Army has been immeasurable, and he will certainly be missed."</p>
			<p>Campbell explained that the organization "will continue to move forward with all essential priorities under the direction of" Maj. Gen. Robert "Bo" Dyess, who has served as deputy director of ARCIC since July 2015, "until a replacement is named for Lt. Gen. McMaster."</p>
			<p>Campbell noted that "ARCIC and TRADOC were already in the process of preparing for the planned departure of Lt. Gen. McMaster later this summer."</p>
			<p>As senior service officials work to identify a successor for McMaster, "it really becomes a question of which direction they want ARCIC to go, and what's most important to them for the leader," Lt. Gen. Mike Murray told ITA in a Feb. 23 interview. -- Courtney McBride</p>

						The State of NCO Development Town Hall 3, conducted Nov. 3, 2016, focused on how Soldiers can get ahead in their careers, or talent management. Topics included operational and broadening assignments as well as commissioning programs, such as ROTC, Officer Candidate School, West Point and Warrant Officer Candidate School. This live town hall provided Soldiers with an opportunity to ask senior leaders questions.

						<p>
						One of the Army’s chief strategists warns of an “urgent” need to upgrade Army ground combat platforms to respond to the increased lethality of the modern battlefield.

Speaking at a daylong “Hot Topics” forum hosted by the Association of the U.S. Army, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, director of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command’s Army Capabilities Integration Center, said, “We are in a period of increasing risk to our Army’s ability to fight, win and accomplish the mission against increasingly capable enemies.”

WASHINGTON (Army News Service) -- It's a unique situation that the Army doesn't currently have a ground combat vehicle under development, said Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster Jr. That hasn't happened since World War I.

&amp;At current funding levels, the Bradley and Abrams will remain in the inventory for 50 to 70 more years,&amp; he said in his remarks as the keynote speaker Tuesday at a professional development forum for The Association of the United States Army's Institute of Land Warfare.

							 <p>WASHINGTON (Army News Service) -- The Army's next-generation combat vehicle will probably run on alternative energy sources and feature directed-energy weapons, advanced-composite armor and an active protection system, experts said Tuesday.

"There's a solid four years of analysis that has to occur" before decisions are made on procurement requirements, said Col. William T. Nuckols, director of the Mounted Requirements Division at the Maneuver Center of Excellence. Nuckols chaired a panel at the Association of the U.S. Army's Institute of Land Warfare "Hot Topic" forum focusing on Army ground combat platforms.</p>

      <title>For the U.S. Army, It’s Not About the Story</title>
      <author>Nadia Schadlow</author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[    
                    
                       <article>
							 <p>Recently, the new Army Secretary Eric Fanning repeated what by now is a familiar refrain in defense policy circles: The Army must tell its story better in order to get the resources it needs.  The “tell the story better” narrative is by now a familiar one — and a misguided one.</p>
							 <p>The fundamental problem is not the quality of the Army story; the problem is a fundamental disagreement about what current and future warfare entails. It is a disagreement over how to design military forces to achieve desired strategic and political outcomes within resource constraints and trade-offs. It is a disagreement over the theory of warfare held by the Army on the one hand, and the theory of warfare held by a large number of policy analysts on the other — including much of today’s civilian political leadership.</p>
							 <p>As a recent article by Army Major Robert Chamberlain points out, a theory of warfare is a description of how a military intends to produce strategic outcomes. A theory of warfare guides the kind of force that you need to grow and field to produce a desired strategic outcome. Army senior leaders have expressed how they believe the Army will likely fight now and in the future. The purpose of this brief article is  not to capture this theory fully, but rather to point out that the Army has told its story of how near- and medium-term wars are likely to be fought, and the service has argued for an endstrength and force modernization program based on this view. What parts of the Army story are critics rejecting and why? That should be the focus of the discussion.</p>
							 <p>The Army view is that conflicts in the future, like those in the past, will ultimately be resolved on land. Army forces will be essential components of joint operations to create sustainable political outcomes while defeating enemies and adversaries who challenge U.S. advantages in all domains: land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace. Army contributions to joint operations provide multiple options to civilian and military leaders. These capabilities include tailorable and scalable combinations of special operations and conventional forces, regionally aligned and globally responsive combined arms teams, and foundational theater capabilities to enable joint operations.</p>
							 <p>Land-based threats emanate from the fielded forces of hostile nation states and from areas where state weakness allows non-state enemy or adversary organizations to operate. Conflict often arises from disorder, and land forces are needed to overcome the effects of this disorder. Although the ability to project power onto land from the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains will remain vital to joint operations, the employment of land forces will remain essential to achieve political outcomes.</p>
							 <p>Army leaders have made the case that the continuities in the character of war are just as important as any changes in warfare. As Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley explained, wars are ultimately decided on the ground. Because the desire for control over territory, populations, and resources is a frequent cause of war — witness the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)  today — the Army’s ability to deny enemy control of the land domain is fundamental to prevailing in armed conflict. The ability to control territory remains a critical function of the Army, and arguments about Army end strength are linked to assumptions about this fundamental characteristic of warfare.</p>
							 <p>Moreover, because territory matters, the ability to consolidate gains matters as well. The Army’s theory of warfare argues that forces must be able to compel outcomes without the cooperation of the enemy and that achieving sustainable political outcomes will require the consolidation of combat gains through the establishment of stable environments. Consistent with this view of warfare, the Army has rejected idea that wars of the future will necessarily be short. “Wars are funny things. They have a logic all of their own. And they rarely conform to preplanned timelines,” Milley has said.</p>
							 <p>Since the environment will remain unpredictable, the Army theory of warfare holds that its forces must be able to fight and prevail along the full spectrum of conflict, from stability operations to high-intensity conventional conflict. Army former   Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence Gen. Mary Legere has explained that in today’s complex security environment, the Army does not have the luxury of a single opponent or threat and must be prepared to respond to all adversaries. Milley has explained that the Army must sustain the counterterrorist and counterinsurgency capabilities that it developed over the past 15 years “while simultaneously rebuilding the capability to win in ground combat against higher-end threats such as Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.” The National Commission on the Future of the Army backed up the view that demands for Army forces are increasing.</p>
							 <p>To achieve the ability to fight across the spectrum of conflict and respond quickly to contingencies, Army leaders have consistently argued for protecting readiness and for linking readiness and end strength to deterrence, since “you can only deter your opponent if your opponent believes that you have the will and the capability.” Deterrence depends upon the ability to deny the enemy the ability to accomplish its objectives. Some senior Army leaders such as Gen. Ben Hodges would prefer forward-stationed units (such as brigade combat teams in Europe), a smaller Army and political decisions outside of their control preclude this in the near term. Army leaders have expressed skepticism that wars can be won with advanced technologies, arguing that “after the shock and awe comes the march and fight.” They likewise believe that combat vehicles will continue to play a central role in warfare, providing soldiers with mobility, lethality, and protection to defeat enemy forces and/or seize, occupy, and defend land areas. The operational environment is not going to be static, and Army forces must be prepared to transition rapidly between major combat, military-to-military engagement, and humanitarian assistance. The Army will need to continuously combine offensive, defensive, and stability operations through a blend of combined arms maneuver and wide-area security (which includes counterinsurgency).</p>
							  <p>Gen. Milley and other leaders have made the case that prevailing in war takes more than killing high-value terrorists with drone strikes and small-unit raids, and that special forces cannot do it all. Nor can a small Army simply grow when needed. Milley has also pointed out that if the Army becomes too small, the nation cannot simply recruit more people, put them through basic training, and “presto,” have a unit. Soldiers take years to develop the competencies and skills necessary to wage modern ground combat.</p>
							 <p>Under the guise of “tell a better story,” defense leaders are talking past each other and avoiding the tough conversations they should be having. Secretary of the Army Fanning should engage critics over the specific aspects of the kinds of war they believe are most likely to unfold, since there are implicit and unchallenged assumptions that underpin the views of those who claim that the Army needs to do better at telling the story. Should the United States reconsider its position on forward presence in Europe?  How important is the Army for providing a robust deterrent to America’s adversaries? And perhaps most importantly, will the ability to control territory from the land remain fundamental to warfare in the future?</p>

        Q &amp; A Session on Megacities with Dr. Kira Hutchinson, TRADOC's Lead for the Mad Scientist Initiative
      </title>
      <author>TRADOC G9</author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[      
                    
                       <article>
                           <h4><b><i><span class="text-muted">G9:</span> What was the purpose behind the Mad Scientist Megacities Conference?</i></b></h4>
                           <p><span class="">Dr. Hutchinson:</span> By 2050, 60% of the world’s population is expected to reside in cities. Adversaries are increasingly moving to environments where U.S. advantages in detection, standoff, and precision firepower may be constrained. Further, the potential for Army involvement within cities may be exacerbated by global challenges including: liberal trade and economic coordination; climate change; nuclear proliferation; responsibility to protect, and failing states and ungoverned areas. With this in mind, we conducted a conference to address four primary objectives in how to operate in Megacities: situational understanding, freedom of movement and protection, expeditionary operations, and future training challenges.</p>


                           <h4><b><i><span class="text-muted">G9:</span> What were some of your key findings in developing situational understanding?  </i></b></h4>
                           <p><span class="">Dr. Hutchinson:</span> We found that the challenge of megacities is density, not just in people, but also in data and infrastructure. Having an understanding of terrain is key, particularly physical overlaid with cyber-social. We noticed that invisible geography requires understanding of the formal and informal social networks, not obvious to those unfamiliar with the region. Big data analytics of social media will provide access to a population’s collective intelligence; insights which are achieved through examination of aggregate behaviors. Finally, developing common data sets for megacity models is critical for building a Commander’s visualization. Although each megacity is unique (demographics, infrastructure, threats), there are similarities in data to frame analysis.  </p>

                           <h4><b><i><span class="text-muted">G9: </span>Can you give us any additional insights that your team found in the area of developing situational understanding?</i></b></h4>
                           <p><span class="text-warning"></span>Dr. Hutchinson: For one, cyber-social analysis can lead to a better understanding of drivers of instability in megacities like disease vectors. Surveillance through integrated sensor architectures, of which humans are a critical component, is required to achieve accurate, timely diagnosis during a humanitarian crisis. We also found that the interconnectedness of biosecurity underpins a “one health” concept. The health of the planet cannot be maintained by ensuring health in first world countries. In fact, disease does not recognize socio-economic borders.  </p>

                           <h4><b><i><span class="text-muted">G9:</span>So, cyber-social analysis is an important aspect of understanding the Human Dimension operating in the future environment? </i></b></h4>
                           <p><span class="text-warning"></span>Dr. Hutchinson: Cyber space is a human space, a global commons of human practice, rapidly becoming the preferred space to engage. The future will be increasingly populated by a new species: Homo sapiens sapiens.net, which will live their entire lives connected to a global virtual network. Homosapiens.net will gravitate towards virtual environments for learning and engagement, and this virtual world will change the concept of identity. </p>

                           <h4><b><i><span class="text-muted">G9: </span>What type of protection appears to be preeminent when operating in a megacity?</i></b></h4>
                           <p><span class="text-warning"></span>Dr. Hutchinson: When considering protection, medical considerations proved to be preeminent. First, humanitarian missions will require a surge capacity due to the sheer density of people. Response forces require innovative ways to manage waste disposal and protective suits with communications for long duration operations. ‘Hot Zone Robotics’ could mitigate some of the problems with golden hour care for thousands of casualties. We believe robots will be capable of conducting triage, providing emotional support, remotely diagnosing, and providing basic care. </p>

                            <h4><b><i><span class="text-muted">G9: </span>What are some of the future improvements you believe will enhance the Army’s ability to perform expeditionary operations in a megacity?</i></b></h4>
                           <p><span class="text-warning"></span>Dr. Hutchinson: As you know, laying siege to a megacity or dense urban area is an outdated notion. With this in mind, we see tremendous advances in the use of avatars as a force enabler in conducting megacity operations. Avatars in the field will be capable of face-to-face interactions and conducting interviews, as well as assist Leaders in language translation and decision making. Human/machine teaming will outperform a group of humans working together or a computer working independently. This teaming is critical if the environment is too dangerous, imposing restrictions on human access. Unmanned systems will provide many opportunities for freedom of movement. Vertical Takeoff and Landing is critical in megacities. </p>

                            <h4><b><i><span class="text-muted">G9: </span>What are the training challenges involved in preparing for future megacity missions?</i></b></h4>
                           <p><span class="text-warning"></span>Dr. Hutchinson: Due to the challenges replicating a megacity training area, virtual environments will be needed to emulate specific areas and provide home station training repetitions. Interdisciplinary collaboration is critical to understanding and addressing complex problems in megacities.  Most of this expertise will be outside of the Army. TRADOC is assessing the need for a megacity study center to synchronize TRADOC’s learning efforts and to increase outreach to external organizations like ASU.</p>

      <title>JLTV Will be US Army’s Interim Light Recon Vehicle</title>
      <!--Update!-->
      <author>Jen Judson</author>
      <!--Update!-->
      <description>
        The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle will serve as the interim light reconnaissance vehicle for the US Army, according to Maj. Gen. Bo Dyess, the Army Capabilities Integration Center’s deputy director.

        The idea has been floated as a possibility since late last year but Dyess firmed up the Army’s plan to use JLTV as an interim solution for the Army’s LRV on Wednesday at the National Defense Industrial Association’s Tactical-Wheeled Vehicle conference in Reston, Virginia.

      <title>Interactive workshop discusses negotiation tactics</title>
      <!--Update!-->

      <description>
        The seventh annual West Point Negotiations Workshop took place at the Jefferson Library Haig Room April 14-15. The two-day conference included speakers Professor Jeff Weiss and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, accompanied by commissioned and non-commissioned officers from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, to discuss negotiation tactics in military, business and everyday applications.

        Cadets and midshipmen from the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, Royal Military College of Canada and ROTC came together to participate in this two-day interactive workshop in attempts to leave them with the basic tools of negotiations and information acquisition, in which they can apply in their endeavors as military leaders and civilians in the private sector.

        On the first day of the workshop, West Point Negotiation Project Officer in Charge, Maj. Michael Rybacki, and Weiss led the group through the introduction of principled negotiations, encouraging the participants to challenge their own assumptions about negotiations, learn the seven elements of principled negotiation: relationship, communication, interest, option, legitimacy, alternative, commitment, develop a systematic measure of success, and understand how to apply principled negotiations to real world scenarios.

        Throughout the conference, Weiss, one of the founders of the workshop in 2009, and Rybacki taught the students how to think about negotiations differently.

        “What I learned about negotiations is that it’s not necessarily arguing, it’s about cooperating, which I thought was pretty interesting,” West Point Class of 2019 Cadet Dalton Stahl said. “Honestly, I didn’t really know what I was going to get out of this conference but I think it’s definitely helped me grow in many ways as a leader and a person dealing with every day challenges, as well as big decisions.”

        Class of 2018 Cadet Marcos Arroyo, a member of the West Point Negotiations Project, explained that one purpose of the conference was to help with those day to day issues.

        “You use principle negotiations in pretty much every single aspect of your life,” Arroyo said. “And we can apply it to bigger skills stuff like political negotiations or business negotiations … There’s a lot of components that people really just overlook.”

        Throughout the workshop, participants were guided through a series of exercises and role-playing scenarios that consisted of topics ranging from “difficult conversations with a boss” to “host nation local-national contract support.”

        Following each of these exercises, the cadets were guided through a debrief, where the other members of their working groups conduct an after-action review prior to beginning the next exercise in order to determine what worked well, what are areas to develop in their negotiation repertoire.

        Alex Clark, the cadet in charge, said this was his third year being a part of the workshop and the skills he’s learned over the years have helped him tenfold.

        “Our conference’s ultimate goal is aimed at training future Army officers or military officers in the art of negotiation to hopefully have a lasting impact on the relationships we form and ultimately prove our capacity to serve as a military officer,” Clark said.

        On April 15, Lt. Gen. McMaster, an early advocate and supporter of the West Point Negotiations Project, spoke to students about different scenarios in which principled negotiations were or would have been useful overseas from his vast experiences as an officer in the Army.

        “The first thing you got to do is you got to build a relationship and you have to do a lot more listening than you do talking and you have to really begin to understand what the issues are,” McMaster said. “Then you really got to try to understand the solution space, understand your interests, their interests and what you can do together, right? To satisfy their interests and your interests both.”

        By using current matters, McMaster allowed the students to apply negotiations principles to existing topics.

        He said that reading and learning about previous battles would allow the future lieutenants and current officers to better frame and understand problems.

        “Read those books that interest you that will help you develop your own strategic judgement and to see how you can fit in your experiences as non-commissioned officers, as officers,” McMaster said. “By learning from others’ experiences you can ensure your vision of what battle is going to be like in the future, how you’re going to prepare your Soldiers, sailors, airmen, or Marines, and you can build onto your training.”

        McMaster left the audience with a few key notes. He said that today, we have to emphasize allies more than ever and that American military power is joint power.

        Finally, he told the negotiators to remember that there are no short-term solutions to long-term problems.

        “Lt. Gen. McMaster gave his explanation on how to do this sort of thing on a strategic level, which was really neat,” Class of 2018 Midshipman Artem Sherbinin said.

        Sherbinin noted how he enjoyed learning skills on both strategic and tactical levels while applying those skills in the real world.

        He also said that the negotiations models he learned throughout the conference were new and fresh and he is excited to put them into practice.

        “You’re not just focusing on what you want as your end goal, you’re kind of working through their perceptions and through what they’re trying to achieve, as well as get your end result,” Sherbinin noted. “So it’s not a back and forth based on just principles, or your essential end goal, but rather how you can work with that person or how you can work with that group to achieve both of your goals.”

        By the end of the conference, all the participants were inundated with a solid foundation of principled negotiation in which they can further apply and develop as they take their position as future leaders themselves.

        Cadets and officers interested in learning more about Negotiations are encouraged to visit the WPNP website at http://www.usma.edu/wpnp/.

        The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, Frank Kendall, and the Principal Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, Lt. Gen. Michael Williamson, explored Fort Bliss, Texas, this month to interact with Soldiers and observe firsthand the new technologies under assessment during the Network Integration Evaluation 16.1.

        The event, known as NIE, concluded Oct. 8 and was the final proof-of-concept for the Army Warfighting Assessments (AWAs), large-scale exercises that begin next year as a venue to assess new concepts and capabilities supporting Force 2025 and Beyond.

      <title>A New Way To Command: Army Links Its Networks</title>
      <author>Sydney J. Freedberg Jr. </author>
      <description>
        CRYSTAL CITY: Left with a patchwork of field and homebase systems as military networking exploded after 9/11, the Army is striving to rationalize its systems so troops can train with the same systems they fight with.

        “During the last 12-13 years at war, units were buying capabilities that were not consistent across the board at home station just to make sure they can communicate,” said the Army’s chief information officer (G-6), Lt. Gen. Robert Ferrell. Units ending up having one set of systems they used for command, control, and coordination when in the US and a different set they used during deployments.

        That’s a problem for training, for maintenance, and for conducting the smaller, quicker deployments called for in the Army Operating Concept. Now, with wartime budgets shrinking and the wartime legions of IT contractors going away, the Army wants to rationalize its networks into something it can more easily train on and support.

      <title>Mock-Combat Exercises Assess Latest Technologies</title>
      <author>Kris Osbourne</author>
      <description>
        Soldiers from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division flew through the sky as part of a forced entry air assault jump into hostile territory before setting up a perimeter, securing their forced landing and unleashing full-scale combat operations upon battle enemies – all as part of an ongoing Army exercise at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.

        The Army is finishing up a massive mock-combat drill in the desert designed to assess next-generation technologies, refine doctrine, advance communication with NATO allies and prepare soldiers for the warfare of tomorrow, service officials said.

      <title> US Army Wants More Firepower across Formations, General Says</title>
      <author>Matthew Cox</author>
      <description> LTG McMaster spoke about the needs of the future force at the recent 2015 Maneuver Warfighter Conference at Fort Benning GA. One of the goals of Force 2025 is to strive to achieve overmatch capabilities against our current and future threats. One way to ensure this is to provide greater lethality in firefights. "And so what we are trying to do now is ensure that every formation in our Army has the appropriate combination of mobility, protection and lethality to overmatch the enemy," he said. "We don't want 14-hour firefights. We want four-second firefights." The final outcome is to ensure that, even if we don't start the fight, we can and will end the fight.  </description>

      <title>The Integrated Army Warfighting Challenge Capabilities-based Assessment</title>
      <author>ARCIC</author>
      <description> The Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) are the Army’s enduring problems, the solutions to which improve combat effectiveness for the current and future force. The AWFCs are important to the Army because they integrate across warfighting functions (mission command, intelligence, movement and maneuver, fires, engagement, maneuver support and protection, and sustainment) to help understand how units and leaders combine capabilities to accomplish the mission. </description>

      <title>The U.S. Army’s Human Dimension Strategy</title>
      <author>CAC</author>
      <description> Given the current realities of reduced budgets with no reduction in security requirements, the Army has placed emphasis on the Human Dimension (HD). The U.S. Army Human Dimension Concept (May 2015) defines HD as the cognitive, physical, and social components of Soldier, Army Civilian, leader, and organizational development and performance essential to raise, prepare, and employ the Army in unified land operations. The concept calls for the Army to focus on human performance optimization—the process of applying knowledge, skills, and emerging technologies to improve and preserve the capabilities of our human capital to execute essential tasks. </description>

      <title>Shaping the Future Army</title>
      <author>ARCIC</author>
      <description> Winning in a complex world and maintaining overmatch are two major topics of discussion that have been energized by the Army Operating Concept. The framework being used to structure the discussions within and outside of the Army are the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs). The AWFCs provide the analytical framework being used to stimulate and guide the discussion and refinement of capabilities for Force 2025 and Beyond. The tool being used to facilitate the exchange of ideas and foster collaboration on the AWFCs is milSuite, a collection of online tools and applications produced by the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) for the purpose of bringing collaboration methods and secure communities to the entire Department of Defense.</description>

      <title>Counter Improvised Explosive Devices</title>
      <author>ARCIC</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army Operating Concept, Win in a Complex World and the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) describe how future Army forces operate to accomplish campaign objectives and protect United States national interests. Intelligence assessments and the Army family of concepts, along with strategy and planning documents, tell us that, within this environment, the IED will remain an enduring threat - “the single most effective countermeasure to U.S. Army advantages in armor protection, mobility, firepower and survivability…” (Army Counter Explosive Improvised Device Campaign Plan). General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, further stated: “Improvised explosive devices remain the single most dangerous threat to our soldiers—all branches and all ranks—on the battlefield. They are very clearly an enduring threat.” The Army Capability Integration Center (ARCIC), in concert with the Training and Doctrine Command’s Centers of Excellence (CoE), is leading the effort to mitigate this threat and promote freedom of action, preservation of combat power and an enhanced security environment.  </description>

      <author>Chief, Training &amp; Industry Collaboration Branch, Science and Technology Division</author>
      <description>As the Army Operating Concept challenges us in developing future forces, we must anticipate changing conditions to ensure that Army forces are manned, trained, and equipped to overmatch enemies in order to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative.  New technologies have the potential to simplify systems, increase our capabilities, reduce the cost of operation and ensure resiliency.  To increase the rate of innovation the Army needs an engagement strategy to help inform a wider selection of industry about the Army’s emerging capability needs and includes the industrial base earlier in the discussions as we move from concepts to capabilities.</description>

      <author>MAJ Greg Napoli and CW3 Roosevelt Williams</author>
      <description>Army Command Posts (CPs), which are unit headquarters where the commander and staff perform their activities, are often supported through a series of unconnected computer networks. In fact, four separate computer networks support Mission Command, Intelligence, Logistics, and Telemedicine. These network systems provide considerable capability to the Commander, but require a large physical footprint that increases cost, complexity and reduces CP maneuverability.</description>

      <title>Close Air Support: An Essential Element to Joint Combined Arms Operations</title>
      <author>LTC Howard Murray and Mr Chris Stolz</author>
      <description>Close Air Support (CAS) is defined as "air action by fixed or rotary wing aircraft against hostile targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces and that require detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those force."  From the first bombs dropped by hand on World War I trenches to Reaper strikes directed by troops in contact in Afghanistan, air assets have provided lifesaving and mission essential close air support to ground forces.</description>

      <description>The future operating environments in which the United States Army will operate pose complex challenges due to the rapidly evolving nature of armed conflict.  To win in these environments, the Army conducts experimentation campaigns to think clearly about these challenges and determine the requirements to support future concepts and capabilities development efforts. The UNIFIED CHALLENGE 2014 Experiment campaign provided valuable insights that will inform the Army's transition to Force 2025 and Beyond.</description>

      <author>Cpt. Tony D. Bowers, BMC Public Affairs</author>
      <description>From combat operations to humanitarian efforts, the United States military has learned many lessons over the last decade that are applicable toward current and future operations. Today's Army finds itself in a more complex operating environment filled with coalition forces, interagency partners, and intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations. This multifaceted operational environment coupled with a myriad of cohorts has demonstrated a need for a network capable of supporting and integrating communication from various organizations.</description>

      <description>Force 2025 and Beyond is the Army's strategy to ensure the future joint force can win in a complex world.  Force 2025 improves the force's lethality, mobility, survivability, and expeditionary capabilities.  In accordance with the Army Operating Concept (AOC), Army forces will provide the foundational capabilities required by the joint force.  These foundational capabilities include command and control, along with the ability to project power onto land and from land across the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.</description>

      <description>Is that a Boeing 707 out on a military flight line?  I thought those aircraft had been retired years ago.  This may be the thought running through your head when you see the old bird that made it's first flight more than 57 years ago, which Boeing stopped manufacturing 35 years ago. They can even claim to have flown "The Beatles" to the United States for the first time in this aircraft, back in 1964 when it was state of the art.</description>

      <title>Reducing Acquisition Timelines Through Focused Analyses</title>
      <author>COL Thomas Dillingham, Chief, Studies and Analyses, ARCIC</author>
      <description>Senior leaders, requirement developers, and acquisition stakeholders frequently share frustrations with me about the length of time it takes to complete an Alternative of Analysis (AoA).  They often ask, "What kind of 'good enough' analysis can we do that won't take as long but fulfills the intent and requirement?"  I've struggled for more than a year to find a meaningful answer to that question – one that would be satisfactory to me, my colleagues, and senior leaders.</description>

      <title>Force 2025 and Beyond: The Way Ahead</title>
      <author>Brig. Gen. Gary Brito</author>
      <description>The Army is engaged in a significant effort to ensure that the future force is prepared to defend the nation and accomplish missions across the full range of military operations. Simply put, future Army forces must be prepared to win in a complex world, to borrow the title of the TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1. What follows is an outline of the way ahead for our Force 2025 and beyond campaign—how the Army will think, learn, adapt, evolve and innovate over roughly the next 25 years.</description>

      <author>Future Warfare Division, ARCIC</author>
      <description>From Jan. 13-15 the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) hosted the Unified Quest 15 (UQ15) Innovation Symposium at the College of William &amp; Mary to study the best practices toward innovation within the U.S. military and defense industry.  Assembling personnel from the business, academic, and military community, this UQ15 event was an example of the Army's ongoing pursuit of innovation.  Participants examined obstacles and opportunities for Army innovation and provided recommendations to senior leaders to improve force modernization efforts such as Force 2025 and Beyond.</description>

      <title>ARCIC delivering a tailorable, scalable Mission Command Network</title>
      <author>MAJ Brian Bauer, Architecture Integration and Management Division, ARCIC</author>
      <description>For most of the last decade, Army network improvements have focused on the Brigade as the critical Army formation.  ARCIC's Architecture Integration and Management Division (AIMD) is making a concerted effort to improve the network for Army Divisions and Corps, the most common headquarters tapped to become a Joint Task Force.  Ensuring these formations have the network capacity to handle the demands of a Combined (international partners) and Joint (multi-service) Task Force is a critical element of the Army's ability to continue serving as the foundation for joint formations.</description>

      <title>Cluster Munitions No More: What this means for the U.S. Military</title>
      <author>Mike Jacobson, Fires Division, ARCIC</author>
      <description>The United States will end the use of cluster munitions by January 2019.  In 2008, when the U.S. government committed itself to disposing of cluster munitions by January 2019, it seemed distant. However, when the Department of Defense (DoD) implements the final phase of this policy, it will deprive itself of a critical capability without an identical replacement.</description>

      <author>ARCIC S&amp;T Division</author>
      <description>Since World War II, possessing the operational and functional technology advantage, also referred to as overmatch, has been one of the cornerstones of our nation's defense.  ARCIC, as directed by the Secretary of the Army in General Order No. 4, is charged with the "validation of research and development priorities for key Army science and technology needs".  In short, ARCIC speaks on behalf of the Warfighter to shape Army S&amp;T efforts today, so these technologies can inevitably retain and increase our advantages in the future.</description>

      <author>Mr Stephen Murray, Requirements Integration Directorate (RID), LandWarNet Division (LWND)</author>
      <description>The Network remains one of the Army's top modernization priorities. Army forces require a coherent and integrated network capability to move information seamlessly under universal conditions and support all phases of Joint operations. LandWarNet enables warfighting and generating force functions by providing a manageable, interoperable, integrated, network enterprise from Post / Camp / Station to the tactical edge that connects all of our forces, systems, platforms, and installations into a collaborative environment.</description>

      <description>Following the development of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Simulator Networking (SIMNET) effort, and other Defense and Service efforts in the 1990s to use distributed simulations to support training, testing, and experimentation, the Army developed more realistic and complex synthetic environments.  These environments were designed to investigate and understand new problems, concepts and solutions.</description>

      <description>The Army Chief of Staff's future study plan, Unified Quest 2014, examined how military forces might conduct operations in or around a mega city as well as the operational approaches to achieve military success in urban environments in a 2030-2040 time period. The seminar assembled more than 75 participants representing the Army Staff, Army Centers of Excellence, U.S. Army Africa Command, U.S. Army Special Operations Command, field operating agencies, sister services and eleven allied nations. The seminar's keynote speaker, David Kilcullen, author of "Out of the Mountains," framed the characteristics of mega cities in the context of military challenges.</description>

      <title>Capabilities Development for Long Range Precision Fires</title>
      <author>Fires Division, ARCIC</author>
      <description>The Army's LRPF capabilities are the longer range (270+ km) Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and the shorter range (70+ Km) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) - both launched from the same two air-transportable, ground mobile systems.  They are uniquely versatile complements to the mix of joint munitions available to division, corps and joint units - enabling them to immediately employ significant quantities of highly responsive, all-weather, long range precision fires across the range of military operations.  GMLRS and ATACMS variants deliver either a single high explosive "unitary" or cluster munition warhead against point and area targets.</description>

      <title>New Human Dimension Council will Optimize Soldier Potential</title>
      <author>Human Dimension Task Force (HTDF), Army Capabilities Integration Center</author>
      <description>War is inherently a human endeavor, and the resolution of conflict will require human interaction.  In the near future, the Army will be challenged with complex operational environments, changing fiscal realities, and domestic demographic trends.  To meet and overcome these challenges, the Army realizes that investments in the Soldier are the key the Army's success on the battlefield.</description>

      <title>Total Army Analysis</title>
      <author>MAJ Brian P. Wilkins, Requirement Integration Directorate, ARCIC</author>
      <description>Total Army Analysis (TAA) is the Army process that determines the Program Objective Memorandum or POM Force.  The POM Force is normally released to the Army in the Army Structure Message, or ARSTRUC.  Within the TAA process, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) has two roles.  The first is to represent TRADOC as an Army Command within the generating force.</description>

      <description>One of the primary outputs from the Army's Capabilities Needs Analysis (CNA) process is a single list of prioritized capability gaps recognized by Capabilities Development community stakeholders.  CNA drives Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) documents development, facilitates science and technology (S&amp;T) investments, and informs Campaign of Learning (CoL) objectives.</description>

      <title>ARCIC Experimentation provides intellectual "start point" for Force 2025</title>
      <author>Michala M. Smith</author>
      <description>The FY14 Army Experimentation Program is a series of experiments that will assess the Army's capability to meet projected operational challenges through 2025.  This effort establishes the intellectual "start point" for Force 2025 by experimenting with Army 2020 force designs, augmented with science and technology available in 2025, and employed in the context of the Army Operating Concept within projected force constraints.   A series of five experiments (designated UNIFIED CHALLENGE) will cover all phases of a Joint operation—from shaping the environment, to major combat operations, to enabling civil authorities at conflict termination.  UNIFIED CHALLENGE is led by the Joint and Army Experimentation Division, within the Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC), and executed by TRADOC and Army Battle Labs in cooperation with the Concepts community of practice.</description>

      <title>The Caged Lion: A Short Analysis of British Military Expeditionary Capability in the Days of Austerity</title>
      <author>ARCIC International Army Programs Directorate (IAPD)</author>
      <description>The British military is easily among the most professional and capable military forces in the world. It has a long history of punching above its weight and winning when victory seemed impossible. In the current political environment Her Majesty's Government seeks to reduce military expenditure while maintaining strategic and ideological commitments. This reduction in military spending has greatly reduced the British military's ability to unilaterally project expeditionary power across the globe. In effect the British lion is caged upon its island.</description>

      <title>Capability Set Flyaway Team Training</title>
      <author>Joseph Janisheck PhD.</author>
      <description>Over the last six months, representatives from the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) and 2-1 AD have provided Leader Network Training for Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) fielding mission command Capability Set (CS) 13 and 14.  The "flyaway" team training concept was developed to provide war fighters fielded with the Army's newest mission command and communications systems Tactic, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for operational use.   Feedback from early capability set fielding indicated that leaders and Soldiers were not gaining the operational employment considerations documented by 2-1 AD over the past three Network Integration Evaluations (NIE). The supplemental training serves as a conduit for the network design review by providing the warfighter a tactical scenario to visualize CS 13 and 14 systems.</description>

      <author>MAJ Kathryn Pegues and LTC(P) Pedro Habic</author>
      <description>ARCIC is facing a future workforce reduction as part of the Army-wide headquarters down-sizing.  As of this posting, the mandated cuts will be taken incrementally over a five year period starting as early as 2015.  The delay between the initial announcement of the impending cuts in August 2013 and the first cut provides opportunity for thoughtful deliberation on how to best apply the manpower reduction. To ensure concept and capability development processes and procedures are clearly understood, ARCIC's Deputy Director, Maj. Gen. William Hix, directed a study effort to graphically illustrate how ARCIC performs seven of its primary functions before considering any manpower reductions.</description>

      <title>Machine Foreign Language Translation:  Mission Enabler for the Soldier</title>
      <author>LTC Michael C. McCall and Patrick O'Malley</author>
      <description>During a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Phoenix, AZ on August 17, 2009, President Barack Obama stated, "...in the 21st century, military strength will be measured not only by weapons our troops carry, but by the languages they speak and the cultures that they understand."  The Department of Defense (DoD) is undertaking more missions in more diverse places than ever before, and recognizes the importance of the armed services operating among populations speaking foreign languages. Traditionally, DoD has used human linguists to support its language translation requirements. However, the increasing need to translate foreign languages, the high cost in time and money for training DoD linguists, coupled with the many issues surrounding the use of contract linguists, has led the DoD to look at other solutions. Machine Foreign Language Translation (MFLT) is one of those solutions.</description>

      <author>Mr. Willis Hintz, Mr. Henry Franke, and MAJ Dave Lange, ARCIC Joint &amp; Army Concepts Division</author>
      <description>The new U.S. Army Functional Concept for Engagement is now published as U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Pamphlet 525-8-5. This foundational Army concept introduces engagement as a new Army warfighting function. The engagement warfighting function is defined as the related tasks and systems that influence the behaviors of a people, security forces, and governments. This concept was developed to fill a gap identified by Army senior leaders in how the Army organizes to conduct operations.</description>

      <author>Requirements Integration Directorate, ARCIC</author>
      <description>Many Soldiers and civilians are unaware that the United States Army possesses a fleet of watercraft.  These assets are often referred to as the "Army's Navy" and run the gamut from small sections of floating causeways to Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) that are 273 feet in length with a cargo carrying capacity of 2,000 tons.  An often asked question is "why does the Army have watercraft in the first place and isn't operating watercraft the job of the Navy"?  USC Title 10 requires the Army to maintain a fleet of organic aircraft and watercraft in order to perform its mission.</description>

      <author>ARCIC</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) engages 16 partner armies through the Foreign Liaison Officer (FLO) program at Ft. Eustis in Virginia.  FLOs assigned to Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) observe and interact with capability developers, trainers, and Army leaders who help them gain a better understanding of how our Army is transforming.  This program strengthens our relationships with these countries, improves understanding and future interoperability and is an essential part of TRADOC's contribution to the Army's security cooperation efforts.</description>

      <title>Far-Term Implications for Army Science and Technology</title>
      <author>Science and Technology Division, CDLD, ARCIC</author>
      <description>Warfare is an inherently human endeavor utilizing tools to achieve effects. Since the first human picked up a stone as a weapon, the race for increasingly sophisticated tools of war has gone unabated. The development from simple Stone Age weapons to today's modern precision guided munitions has required extensive investment and research into Science and Technology (S&amp;T) to gain or maintain an edge on an opponent. The changing nature of scientific discovery and its impact on emerging social, political, economic trends require the nation, especially the Army, to continue its investment in S&amp;T to maintain its competitive edge.</description>

      <title>MSCoE CBRN Soldiers Experiment with Robotic Standoff Detection Capability</title>
      <author>Al Resnick</author>
      <description>Robotic value to the warfighter.  When one accesses the Robotic Systems Joint Project Office (RSJPO) website - http://www.peogcs.army.mil/rsjpo.html - the ever present banner touting the number of lives saved by robots is a constant reminder of their importance. Robots provide the warfighter with a standoff capability that effectively reduce risk when faced with dangerous missions, and is a critical component for decreasing fatalities in potentially-lethal situations.  In 2012, RAND published the "Assessing the Impact of Autonomous Robotic Systems on Army Force Structure" study.</description>

      <author>LTC Matt Dooley</author>
      <description>The dismounted Infantry Squad is the tip of the spear on today's battlefield.  On June 11, 2013 TRADOC completed the Integrated Concept Development Team Squad Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA).  The CBA revealed a number of findings associated with Squad requirements at the tactical level.  One of the more important findings pointed to sensors as absolutely vital to providing stand-off from threats and immediate intelligence for use by the individual soldier</description>

      <author>Mark Pinkerton</author>
      <description>Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have become an integral part of Mission Command systems and play an important role in the successful execution of tactical missions. The key enabling capability provided by GPS is positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) and is primarily enabled through the signal transmissions from GPS satellites. Without accurate PNT the GPS would not function as intended and could result in mission failure and combat casualties.</description>

      <title>ARCIC to Leverage Early Synthetic Prototyping to Shape the Future Army</title>
      <author>LTC Brian Vogt, ARCIC</author>
      <description>How does the Army develop and implement a process and set of tools that enables Soldiers to assess emerging technologies in a synthetic environment to provide relevant feedback to inform Science and Technology investment as well as Doctrine, Organization and Training/Education? Following WWI, major world powers knew that emerging battlefield capabilities such as the tank, airplane, submarine, and aircraft carrier, would fundamentally change the way they'd fight future wars.  This realization led to many wargames, experiments, and studies.  In the United States, the Louisiana Maneuvers shaped the way the Army would fight across Western Europe, while the Navy conducted Blue Sword wargames to shape the way they would fight across the Pacific Ocean.</description>

      <title>Common Architecture Will Increase Efficiency, Maximize Value of Information</title>
      <author>Charles W. Clark Jr.</author>
      <description>Architecture is one of the most talked about and least understood activities within the Army's capabilities development and acquisition communities.  The Department of Defense has published guidance on architectures in the context of information technology (IT) and network design in the Architecture Framework.   Nonetheless, each of the armed services has been left to their own devices for how they develop and integrate their architectures.  For years, the Army lacked a common operating environment across the enterprise that supported the Warfighter, Business, and Network Mission Areas (WMA, BMA, NMA), and associated domains, to satisfy their needs.</description>

      <author>Mr. John Twohig and Mr. Ted Cranford</author>
      <description>In the past several years, the nation began transitioning the Department of Defense from an era of extended conflict back to one of uncertain peace. In 2001, the Army's base budget was ~$75.2B with a supplemental ~$1.1B for a total ~$76.3B. That figure increased to a high of ~$250B ($142B base, $108 supplemental) in 2008. Since then the Army's budget decreased each year to 2013's requested ~$184.6B ($134.5 base, $50.1B supplemental). This continued reduction to the Army's budget directly impacts the Army's manning, acquisition, design, and structure decisions.</description>

      <author>COL Vance P. Visser, Chief, ARCIC, RID, Maneuver Support Protection Division</author>
      <description>The existing threat to the United States posed by Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) is significant and growing.  At least 17 countries maintain sizeable chemical/biological weapons stockpiles and many, such as North Korea, possess amounts exceeding two metric tons.  The threat of conventional nuclear attack remains a national security concern. In October 2013, the Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) established the Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) working group, a cooperative effort co-chaired by Maneuver Support Protection Division (MSPD) and the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE) Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate (CDID).</description>

      <author>Matthew DiGiosaffatte, Analysis and Integration Directorate, ARCIC</author>
      <description>The Army must convert high-level strategic concepts into real-world capabilities that meet Soldiers' needs. Capability Needs Analysis (CNA) helps advise Army budget-makers on how to prioritize limited resources. It also enables knowledge sharing and linkages between the requirements, acquisition, engineering, and warfighting communities. The current form of the Capability Needs Analysis adapts its scope and methods to meet the demands of an Army in transition, now providing analytical and integration coverage across brigade-level Formations while still looking across Warfighting Functions (WfFs) and across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P).</description>

      <title>The Future of Army Electronic Warfare</title>
      <author>Ronald Garhart and Lowell Asher, Mission Command, Intel, and Cyber Division (MCIC), ARCIC</author>
      <description>In the 1990s, with the Soviet threat diminished and budgets shrinking, the Army essentially ceded Electronic Warfare (EW) operations to the Air Force and Navy.  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan quickly forced the Army back into EW, with the requirement to defeat and continuously adapt to Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIEDs).  However, there are some who believe that EW won't be important once the war in Afghanistan ends.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Robot Warfare: U.S. Army Planning has Already Begun</title>
      <author>Dave Shunk, Future Warfare Division, ARCIC</author>
      <description>Army leaders confront constant change from the tactical to strategic level amid increasingly complex environments. In the near future, the Army must anticipate how semi-autonomous combat robots will transform the way the Army fights on land in 2030-2040. Semi-autonomous combat robots may have the same revolutionary impact on land warfare that tanks had on warfare and Army doctrine in the 1930s and 1940s.</description>

      <title>Earlier, Better Analyses in Support of Program Requirements</title>
      <author>John P. Wilson, Studies and Analysis Division, A&amp;ID, ARCIC</author>
      <description>The 2010 Army Acquisition Review (known as the Decker-Wagner Report), recognized the need to conduct more thorough and timely analysis of proposed material acquisition programs, particularly Analyses of Alternatives (AoAs) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (C-BA).  Additionally, our senior leaders communicate an increasing demand for analysis much earlier in the requirements process, as well as throughout a program's development. This is highlighted by Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) mandates requiring AoA study plans at Materiel Development Decisions (MDD).</description>

      <title>Army Air Defense: From System-Centric to Network-Centric</title>
      <author>Keith Anders</author>
      <description>The creation of an integrated system of systems from existing "stove-pipe" systems might seem to be a very daunting task.  However, the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) System of Systems (SoS) has done just that, turning the Army's AMD into a state-of-the-art capability.  As daunting as the creation of AIAMD SoS was, getting the requisite Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) documents approved was just as challenging.</description>

      <author>ARCIC Concept Development and Learning Directorate</author>
      <description>Experimentation drives change.  It is a means to stimulate imagination and increase awareness of the "weak signals" of impending change.  It allows us to see ourselves and the enemy differently - shifting from a reactive to a proactive stance that allows us to recognize and influence change before "strong signals" force us to adapt on others' terms. U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Battle Labs reside in each Center of Excellence (CoE), and are equipped with a capacity and infrastructure that enables each to modernize its warfighting function.</description>

      <title>ARCIC Uses OMS/MP to Ensure New Equipment Meets Soldiers' Needs</title>
      <author>Michael Menard</author>
      <description>History is filled with cases of fielded equipment that was inadequate to accomplish the mission. This is often because the design was based on poor assumptions related to the mission profile or the expected operational environment.  From the early versions of the M16 rifle and its corrosion-induced jamming problems, to performance degradation of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) due to overloading, it is clear that a complete understanding of future usage and environment is key to ensuring its design will get the job done.</description>

      <description>Three seasoned noncommissioned officers (NCOs) from the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC), each with four deployments under their belts, explained how they use their experience to ensure that their recommendations on the systems being evaluated and demonstrated during semi-annual Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs) are honest and reflect what Soldiers need to fill capability gaps.</description>

      <author>ARCIC Requirements Integration Directorate</author>
      <description>The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles is a success story of rapid equipping with which most Soldiers and Army Civilians are familiar. Between 2005 and 2009, the Department of Defense quickly procured and allocated approximately 21,000 MRAPs and Route Clearing/Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) vehicles for the Army in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</description>

      <author>Maj. Michael Lenart, Information Integration Directorate</author>
      <description>CARLISLE BARRACKS, Pa. – The Strategic Landpower Task Force (SLTF) recently completed a Limited Objective Experiment (LOE) to inform the development of the Strategic Landpower Concept. This concept will describe the relationship between the land, cyber, and emerging "human" domains; inform defense planning; and enable the Joint force to plan, prepare, and execute military operations that fully account for the inherent human factors that drive and end conflict. The concept is expected to be complete by late Summer 2013.</description>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[             

 <p><b>What is it?</b><br/>
Unified Challenge is the U.S. Army’s experimentation program that explores the concepts and capabilities the Army needs to meet future challenges. This campaign, led by the Army Training and Doctrine Command’s Army Capabilities Integration Center Concept Development and Learning Directorate, is a continuing effort to examine the requirements needed to build an agile and adaptive future Army of 2030. This program supports the 39th chief of staff of the Army’s second priority, the future Army.
  </p>
  <p>Unified Challenge 16.2, conducted July 31 through Aug. 12, is an Army-level experiment that will look for new ways to organize and operate in the years 2025 through 2030. Commanders and staffs from across the Army, along with sister services, U.S. government and multinational partners will explore these new ways in a future realistic and complex scenario. After rigorous analysis, the results of this event will lead to recommendations for consideration by senior Army leaders.
        </p>

      <title>Army Officials Paint Dire Picture of the State of the Force </title>
      <author>John Harper</author>
      <description>
        "Future Army forces may be not only outnumbered … but we also may face enemies who have overmatch capability over us in some key areas," Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, deputy commanding general of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, said at an Association of the United States Army conference in Huntsville, Alabama on March 15th.

        "We see obviously in Europe in particular that we may have Army forces that are also to some degree out of position to deter conflict or then to respond to and resolve conflict," he added.

        "Our Army has become too light," he said. "Some people made some strange assumptions about the nature of future war that really have not panned out right that you just really need to be lean and nimble" to prevail.

        "We don’t want a fair fight," McMaster said. "If we show up with ‘U.S. Army’ on our chests in large numbers, [we want to ensure] you’re going to get your ass kicked," he said.

      <title>Army moves to electronic publishing</title>
      <author>Michael Casey</author>
      <description>
        FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (June 15, 2015) -- The Army is pushing knowledge to the point of need by making e-Publications, or EPUB, available for download to Soldiers' mobile devices.

        Doctrinal publications are accessible as Portable Document Formats, also known as PDFs, on personal computers and some mobile devices, but viewing them on mobile devices is less than optimal.
        By the end of June, the Army will have converted many Army doctrinal publications to an EPUB format - making it easier to read on computer tablets and smart phones. Depending on the device's sophistication, users can bookmark, highlight and insert notes on the publications.

      <description>
        REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. (June 19, 2015) -- The Army has finished its follow on test and evaluation, or FOTE, on the MQ-1C Gray Eagle and Initial Test and Evaluation on the One System Remote Video Terminal at the National Training Center on Fort Irwin, California.

        Record testing was conducted from May 29 - June 14.

        The Gray Eagle, already in full-rate production since 2013, was being tested on the suitability, survivability and effectiveness of all the new "universal" equipment on the system, including the Universal Ground Control Station, Universal Ground Data Terminals, and the Universal Satellite Communications Data Terminal. The test was also focused on transitioning tasks to decrease reliance on maintenance contractors to ensure that Army equipment can be Soldier-maintained.

      <title>Researchers believe capturing, processing brainwaves will better enable Soldiers</title>
      <author>C. Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Brainwave detection may one day make it easier for Army researchers to train computers to detect threats captured in digital images of the battlefield. Jean Vettel, Ph.D., a neuroscientist with the Army Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, was wearing headgear lined with brain wave-sensing EEG, or "electroencephalography" sensors, May 14, in the Pentagon courtyard as part of the display she manned at DOD Lab Day there. She confirmed almost immediately that, in at least her part of the Army, researchers were not working on how Soldiers might one day control a combat vehicle or helicopter using only their brains.</description>

      <title>Engineers develop ballistic wallpaper to reinforce temporary shelters</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Troops often use abandoned masonry, brick or cinderblock structures for defensive purposes instead of building their own or digging foxholes. While these structures offer a degree of protection, they are blast impact from missile or other large projectiles, said Nick Boone, a research mechanical engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center, or ERDC, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Boone spoke during DOD Lab Day, at the Pentagon, May 14, where a large number of Army laboratory exhibits were on display.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON -- Cyber, electronic warfare and anti-satellite operations are just a few of the threats facing the United States in the Pacific, said a "futurist," who spoke recently at the Pentagon. Addressing a standing-room-only audience of largely logistics Soldiers and civilians from Army G-4, Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr., president of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, spoke on the sustainment and logistics challenges facing the future force, April 23. "You're lucky if you can predict the future, that's what you are," he told the crowd.</description>

      <title>Army looks at credentialing Soldiers for jobs</title>
      <author>Ms. Lisa Ferdinando</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON  -- While the Army does a great job of training Soldiers for the battlefield, it needs to do a better job of getting members credentialed for the civilian marketplace, Maj. Gen. Rex A. Spitler said. There are "great opportunities" for the Army in this area, said Spitler, deputy chief of staff, Army Training and Doctrine Command, also known as TRADOC. Spitler, a keynote speaker at the American Legion National Credentialing Summit here, April 28, said it is a large-scale effort for his command since 500,000 people go through TRADOC schools each year.</description>

      <description>FORT BENNING, Ga., — For the next 10 years, the U.S. Army will operate under a new concept that realigns the focus of battle to building capabilities rather than buying things with which to fight. "What is the guidance, and what are the decisions that you make that drive the whole organization?" said General David Perkins, commanding general, U. S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, as he introduced 'Win in a complex world' to Soldiers as part of a Combat Leaders Speaker Program April 24 in Marshall Auditorium. Perkins referred to the AirLand Battle doctrine, developed when the Army was coming out of Vietnam, whose unifying concept was 'Fight outnumbered, and win.'</description>

      <title>Composites key to tougher, lighter armaments</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>The Army is on the cusp of revolutionizing materials that go into armament construction, making for stronger, lighter and more durable weapons, Dr. Andrew Littlefield said. The key to this revolution is composite materials, said Littlefield, who is a mechanical engineer at the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey. Littlefield's topic, "Lightweighting of Large Caliber Weapons - Present and Future," was presented during the National Defense Industrial Association-sponsored 2015 Armament Systems Forum here, April 21.</description>

      <title>Dailey sets sights on military education</title>
      <author>Sgt. William F Smith (4th ID)</author>
      <description>FORT CARSON, Colo. -- The importance of improving military education while continually improving the Army profession were two topics Sgt. Maj. of the Army Daniel A. Dailey shared with members of the Fort Carson community, April 20-21. "As the Army gets smaller we have to invest in the people who will lead us into the future," Dailey said. "We are revamping the entire military education system. Our education system doesn't transfer well into the civilian sector. While we rebuild our courses force-wide, we are focusing on maximizing opportunity for two programs: credentialing and academic equivalency.</description>

      <title>Odierno: Army Operating Concept can help Army face fiscal challenges</title>
      <author>C. Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- While acknowledging the challenges that slashed budgets have wrought, the Army's chief of staff said the Army Operating Concept, or AOC, will actually help the Army address future challenges. Gen. Ray Odierno addressed Soldiers and industry representatives during the 2015 Association of the United States Army Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, April 1. He told them budget cuts have reduced manning, readiness and modernization, but then he spelled out some of the things that would be needed for the service to continue operating in the current and future global security environment.</description>

      <author>Amy Haviland, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Public Affairs</author>
      <description>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — More than 7,000 military and industry attendees converged on the Von Braun Center here to discuss Army priorities, exchange ideas and showcase new technologies during this week's Global Force Symposium and Exposition. Hosted by the Association of the United States Army, the three-day event consisted of numerous panels and presentations focused on the future force and how it will fight and "Win in a Complex World," according to the Army Operating Concept. But winning requires innovation, and the panel, "Increasing the Rate of Innovation," brought five subject matter experts together to offer their thoughts on increasing and improving Army innovation.</description>

      <title>McMaster outlines innovation, potential risks for Force 2025, beyond</title>
      <author>Amy Guckeen Tolson, Redstone Rocket staff writer</author>
      <description>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- When it comes to the challenge of finding ways to innovate the Army to win in a complex world, Army leaders must be in tune with the risks and fallacies that could lead to undermining their own efforts. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, deputy commanding general, futures/director, Army Capabilities Integration Center, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, addressed attendees during the 2015 AUSA Global Force Symposium on "Army Innovation Under Force 2025 and Beyond," March 31. "We define innovation in the Army Operating Concept as really our ability to turn ideas into valued outcomes," McMaster said. "And then also to be able to do that in a way that we stay ahead of determined, and increasingly capable enemies."</description>

      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Manned-unmanned operations using helicopters linked with unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, have been used by the Army for a number of years. However, no single unit has ever actually been assigned to both assets until now, said Lt. Col. Tory Burgess, product manager for Shadow Tactical UAS. Burgess and others spoke during a media roundtable from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, March 19.</description>

      <title>McHugh: Acquisition reform remains top Army priority</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- "Historically, the Army's track record on acquisition programs is too often a tale of failure," Army Secretary John M. McHugh told senators. McHugh was joined by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the defense authorization request for fiscal year 2016 and the Future Years Defense Program, March 18. There have been "too many underperforming or cancelled programs, too few successful fieldings of developmental designs and far too many taxpayer dollars wasted. We know this and we will do better," McHugh said.</description>

      <title>Odierno: Budget cuts do not support global security environment</title>
      <author>Amaani Lyle, DoD News, Defense Media Activity</author>
      <description>BALTIMORE, Md. -- While the Department of Defense contemplates some $500 billion in budget reductions, the global security environment continues to worsen, Army's chief of staff said. Ultimately, Gen. Ray Odierno said, there is no parity between what the Army is doing - or may be asked to do - and the resources it will be given to accomplish those tasks. "We're being asked to reduce a bit quicker than I think we should," he said, addressing a March 11 meeting of the Baltimore Council of Foreign Affairs.</description>

      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- From live operational updates on board a C-17 aircraft, to satellite terminals the size of a briefcase, to wireless command posts, new communications technologies will support the Army's "ability to get there faster with a lighter footprint," Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Daniel B. Allyn said. Allyn visited Aberdeen Proving Ground, or APG, the Army's hub for tactical network development, acquisition and support, March 11, to meet with Soldiers and view new systems that will support an agile and expeditionary force and strengthen cyber security.</description>

      <title>Army researching uniforms that automatically decontaminate</title>
      <author>C. Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- One day, Soldiers may wear uniforms and chemical protective suits that decontaminate themselves and are cool enough to wear for extended periods. Researchers, such as chemist David McGarvey, Ph.D, at the Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, or ECBC, on Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, are part of a team led by the Natick Soldier Systems Center that is developing just those technologies. The idea is that uniform items are pre-treated with a chemical that can render things harmless including nerve or blister agents.</description>

      <title>ArmyFit's self-development website gets useful upgrades</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- ArmyFit celebrated its first birthday recently, with the addition of several new features to its website. The site, at armyfit.army.mil, is designed to help improve quality of life for Soldiers, families and Army civilians. New features include email notifications and a fitness-tracker interface. But first, a quick overview of the site for those not familiar with it: ArmyFit is primarily a resource site, a "really, really good resource site," said Chaplain (Lt. Col.) Stephen W. Austin, a program developer for the Army Resiliency Directorate, G-1, the organization responsible for collecting and posting the content.</description>

      <title>New process to save Army money, yield cheaper rounds</title>
      <author>Kevin Jackson, AMC</author>
      <description>McALESTER, Okla.  -- A new process at McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, or MCAAP, will make more recovered projectile bodies viable for reuse in the production of field artillery training rounds and provide the military with a cheaper and safer munition, Army officials said. An estimated 95 percent of obsolete and unserviceable D563 projectile bodies recovered from the "soft touch" demilitarization process can feasibly be reused in the 155 mm M1122 high explosive, or HE, munition being manufactured at the plant. The new process changes how the base plate is removed from the projectile so the threads remain intact.</description>

      <title>McHugh details sequestration dangers, talks Army priorities</title>
      <author>Jim Garamone</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- If sequestration triggers this year it will affect every person and mission the U.S. Army has, Army Secretary John McHugh said during a Defense Writer's Group breakfast, Feb. 25. McHugh told reporters that right now his top three priorities are the budget, anything dealing with deployed or forward-deployed forces and combating sexual assault and sexual harassment. The Budget Control Act of 2011 is still the law of the land and that imposes caps on military spending.</description>

      <description>As the Army postures to succeed and win in this complex world, its Force 2025 and beyond campaign plan outlines the need to design and build a force that is more lethal, expeditionary and agile than today's. At the same time, the new "U.S. Army Operating Concept: Win in a Complex World, 2020-2040," spearheaded by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (­TRADOC), acknowledges that success in our complex world may well involve more than just firepower. Since Force 2025 emphasizes speed and lethality, significant opportunities exist to shape and influence the future force across the sustainment acquisition community.</description>

      <title>Odierno, Dailey emphasize trust at Army's SHARP Academy</title>
      <author>Scott Gibson - CAC Public Affairs</author>
      <description>FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan.  -- Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno and Sgt. Maj. of the Army Daniel A. Dailey spoke with students of the Sexual Harassment and Assault Response Program's, or SHARP's, baseline certification course at the SHARP Academy on Fort Leavenworth, Feb. 26. For both members of the Army's most senior command team, this visit was their first since the Army relocated the baseline course at the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center on Fort Leavenworth during October 2014. Odierno spoke to the class about the importance trust plays in the Army's organization, and about the role each class member will play as graduates of the SHARP academy as they become key participants in the preservation of that trust.</description>

      <title>Advancements provide innovative, realistic training</title>
      <author>Capt. Matthew Brown, U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence Directorate of Training and Doctrine</author>
      <description>FORT RUCKER, Ala. -- Today's Army aviation leaders can augment the training process with innovative training techniques and live, virtual, constructive, gaming, and mission command, also known as LVCG-MC, technologies. The adage "train the way we fight" requires leveraging the full spectrum of training enablers to allow aviation leaders and their formations to progress through increasingly complex scenarios, all while replicating an operational environment. From individual crew training through company and higher-combined arms collective training, aviation leaders integrate LVCG-MC technologies towards tough, realistic aviation training.</description>

      <title>New devices may soon help Soldiers nose out chemicals, bio threats</title>
      <author>C. Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUNDS, Md. -- Researchers are refining for Army use a commercial technology that will allow Soldiers to accurately and rapidly detect an array of chemical and biological hazards - from mustard agent to anthrax - and then transmit those results to their higher command. At the same time, the technology is smart enough to differentiate between those chemicals which are dangerous and those that the Soldier has carried with him into the environment on his own skin, such as bug spray or hand sanitizer. The VOCkit system is a small electronic device developed at the Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, or ECBC, and even manufactured there, for now, on the center's 3D printers.</description>

      <title>Female Soldier makes launcher chief history</title>
      <author>Sgt. Joe Dees, 214th Fires Brigade Public Affairs Officer</author>
      <description>FORT SILL, Okla. -- Cpl. Erica Gunter, A Battery, 2nd Battalion, 4th Field Artillery, or 2-4th FA, recently made history when she was promoted to corporal and assigned as a Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS, launcher chief, a position usually held by a staff sergeant. Her new position means that she is the first woman, 13M Military Occupation Specialty, or MOS, to enter the non-commissioned officer corps and be assigned as a launcher chief. While other female 13Ms have attained such status, they were all reclassified into the MOS, whereas Gunter began her career as a 13M two years ago during the second 13M Advanced Individual Training class open to women.</description>

But the pace of innovations needs to pick up if the Army and the joint force are to continue to maintain their edge against enemies who are also increasingly becoming adaptive and innovative, said Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, director of Army Capabilities Integration Center, or ARCIC. McMaster spoke at a media roundtable, Feb. 4, to discuss a recent ARCIC-sponsored symposium on innovation, attended by both military and civilian innovation experts.</description>

      <title>Satellite communications network enables more expeditionary Army to move beyond the FOB</title>
      <author>Mr. Darren LeBlanc, AL&amp;T Magazine</author>
      <description>For the past 13 years, much of the Army fought from forward operating bases (FOBs). The FOBs housed command posts with well-established network infrastructure, which served as an information "home base" for troops between patrols. That approach was well-suited to the operational environment and counterinsurgency mission in Iraq and Afghanistan, but future contingencies and support operations—even the current Ebola response mission in West Africa—demand more flexibility.</description>

      <title>Rapid Equipping Force moves under TRADOC</title>
      <author>Kara Ewell</author>
      <description>FORT BELVOIR, Va. -- The Army's Rapid Equipping Force, or REF, created in 2002 to more quickly meet the materiel needs of commanders operating in Afghanistan, was officially transferred, Jan. 30, to the Army Training and Doctrine Command, also known as TRADOC. Lt. Gen. Kevin W. Mangum, deputy commanding general of TRADOC, presided over the REF patch ceremony at Fort Belvoir, signaling the organization's transition from Headquarters Department of the Army to TRADOC. REF Soldiers and civilian employees now officially report to TRADOC. "The Army leadership's decision to maintain the REF and assign it to TRADOC is an important one," Mangum said. "It signals a clear recognition of the awesome capability and amazing potential inherent in this small, but powerful, organization."</description>

      <title>TRADOC CG emphasizes new operating concept at USAREUR headquarters</title>
      <author>Sgt. Daniel Cole, U.S. Army Public Affairs</author>
      <description>WIESBADEN, Germany  -- Gen. David Perkins, commanding general of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, also known as TRADOC, visited U.S. Army Europe, or USAREUR, headquarters here, Jan. 26, to speak with leaders about the Army's new operating concept; win in a complex world. "When we say win, we say this occurs at the strategic level," Perkins said. "If you want to win at the strategic level you have to deliver all elements of national power, not just firepower." The general also explained that synchronizing the fundamentals, including our military and other militaries, is essential for supporting the new operating concept.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Borders of 'Possible'</title>
      <author>AL&amp;T Magazine</author>
      <description>As the U.S. Army Acquisition Support Center (USAASC) communications staff was exploring the issues surrounding Force 2025 and Beyond, we wanted input from that most futuristic part of DOD, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is renowned for its many breakthroughs and technological disruptions. ACCESS AL&amp;T spoke to Dr. Bradford Tousley, who has been director of the Tactical Technology Office (TTO) at DARPA since January 2013. He holds a B.S. from the United States Military Academy at West Point, and an M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Rochester.</description>

      <title>Improved Army system, training to increase vigilance</title>
      <author>Kristen Kushiyama, CERDEC Public Affairs</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- Soldiers of an Army research center have worked to improve training for fellow Soldiers on a quick-reaction intelligence capability that better supports the system in the field and potentially reduces reliance on reach-back and in-field contractor support. Non-commissioned officers from the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, or CERDEC, have expanded the training Soldiers receive on the Vigilant Pursuit system, a multi-intelligence system designed to reduce the time it takes to properly identify and take down a high-value target.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty means Army must be prepared for multiple threats</title>
      <author>J.D. Leipold</author>
      <description>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. - WASHINGTON -- When the Army began implementing defense cuts in 2011 and 2012, and drawdown operations kicked off in Iraq and Afghanistan, military leadership believed the world would require less intervention on the part of U.S. forces. "Frankly, that's not happened, and I think that's the concern," said Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Ray Odierno, speaking at the Association of the United States Army monthly Institute of Land Warfare breakfast, Jan. 22. "The threat of terrorism is not going away ... it's in our face every single day and it's going to be throughout our lifetimes and probably throughout our children's lifetimes, so we have to figure out how we're going to deal with this threat ... and challenge it face-on," he said.</description>

      <description>ARLINGTON, Va. -- A panel of military officers discussed the concepts of the Strategic Landpower Task Force Jan. 16 at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington, D.C.

      <author>Amy Haviland</author>
      <description>Even in the face of drawdowns and budget challenges, the Army must continue to think of new and better ways to improve the force, and that's exactly what participants were asked to do during the Unified Quest Innovation Symposium Jan. 13-15. In a partnership between U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and the College of William and Mary, professionals from business, academia, think tanks and the military gathered at the college in Williamsburg, Virginia, to explore the challenges and opportunities for innovation in the Army.</description>

      <title>Win in a Complex World - But How?</title>
      <author>TRADOC CG GEN David Perkins</author>
      <description>A Generation of Army officers grew up knowing exactly who the enemy was. Clear lines divided the world into enemy and ally, closed and open, communist and free. The United States made a move, and the Soviet Union countered; the Soviets designed one kind of weapon system, and the United States differentiated its systems accordingly, constantly seeking an edge – until the stalemate cracked and the Soviet bloc walls came down, taking with them the assumptions underpinning Army doctrine.</description>

      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- The White House released a video documenting how a Smithsonian-led team created the first 3-D models of a president. The video highlights the use of an Army-funded Light Stage scanning system, which was key to creating the highest resolution digital model that has ever been made of the head of state. The Mobile Light Stage, delivered to the White House from the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies, or ICT, an Army-sponsored, University Affiliated Research Center that is managed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, collects detailed facial and reflectance data in a process lasting about a second.</description>

      <description>NATICK, Mass. -- To the modern, dismounted warfighter, the saying "knowledge is power" is true, especially when making quick decisions based on limited information. Scientists and engineers from the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, or NSRDEC, are working hard to make information assets a fundamental component of the Soldier's kit. "The ability to collect, process and share battlefield information can greatly improve the chances of mission success and troop survival," said Dr. David Darkow, the Mission Information team leader with NSRDEC's  Warfighter Directorate.</description>

      <description>QUANTICO, VA  -- As a result of recent world events and a continual effort to protect the force, special agents with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command's Computer Crime Investigative Unit are strongly recommending that anyone affiliated with the U.S. military, review their social media accounts to make sure they are using the best security settings to protect their online profiles. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are powerful tools that can help bring communities together. However, an individual's online profile can provide cyber criminals with an endless pool of personal information and potential targets to be exploited.</description>

      <description>WHITE MARSH, Md. -- Sometime early next week, the Army expects to launch the first of two tethered aerostats from a ground base here, just north of Baltimore. The aerostat, part of the "Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor" system, referred to as JLENS for short, is a nearly 250-foot blimp-like vehicle that will stay aloft for a three-year evaluation period. The JLENS aerostat will be tethered to the ground at all times, and will float at an elevation of about 10,000 feet -- just less than two miles high.</description>

      <title>Army training keeps Soldiers resilient during holidays, all year</title>
      <author>Lisa Ferdinando, ARNEWS</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON  -- Currently deployed in Afghanistan, Staff Sgt. Christopher Freeman relies on his Army training, and support from his family and battle buddies to stay Army Strong while thousands of miles from home. Although being away from family is difficult, especially over the holidays, Freeman said knowing he is part of a greater mission puts the separation in perspective and helps reduce the stress. Freeman, a public affairs non-commissioned officer for the International Security Assistance Force, in Kabul, said Army training is invaluable in being resilient.</description>

      <title>Report shows Army making progress in SHARP efforts</title>
      <author>Army News Service</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Army efforts to change command climate and increase training have resulted in a decrease in sexual assaults as well as an increase in reporting of these crimes, a recently released report shows. "The Army still has the prevention of sexual assault as its number-one priority," said Dr. Christine T. Altendorf, director of the Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention program, or SHARP, office. "We have put a lot of focus and effort on this in the last couple of years, and we do believe we are making progress," Altendorf said.</description>

      <author>Capt. Michael Pederson, 116th MI Brigade</author>
      <description>FORT GORDON, Ga. -- As can be seen from the evening news, the military's intelligence mission is more and more important every day. Global instability remains a constant focus for military intelligence. Tasking, processing, exploiting and disseminating intelligence is not a simple job. Intelligence analysts go through a series of checks, re-checks and supervisor approvals before their product, composed through a complex data-gathering process, is authorized for release.</description>

      <title>Developing strategy in complex organizations</title>
      <author>Lt. Col. Stacey Lee</author>
      <description>The military's resource pools were significantly upsized to support the overseas contingency operations of the last decade. However, the military is now facing a smaller budget and must adjust accordingly. The transition to a new normal for resourcing and requirements will present significant challenges for commanders and planners. Organizations looking to get ahead of the changes will need a well-developed and synchronized strategy communicated as a strategic plan, especially in organizations with multiple subordinate schools, sections, and directorates.</description>

      <description>NATICK, Mass. -- Wearable technologies may provide U.S. Soldiers with on-the-move, portable energy and reduce the weight of gear they carry into combat. Researchers at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, or NSRDEC, here, are developing Soldier-borne energy-harvesting technologies. During the Maneuver Fires Integration Experiment, or MFIX, a combined, multi-phase joint training exercise held in September 2014, at Fort Benning, Georgia, researchers tested prototype energy-harvesting technology solutions.</description>

      <title>Army researchers develop pocket-sized aerial surveillance device</title>
      <author>Jeffrey Sisto, NSRDEC Public Affairs</author>
      <description>NATICK, Mass. -- Researchers at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center are developing technologies for a pocket-sized aerial surveillance device for Soldiers and small units operating in challenging ground environments. The Cargo Pocket Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance program, or CP-ISR, seeks to develop a mobile Soldier sensor to increase the situational awareness of dismounted Soldiers by providing real-time video surveillance of threat areas within an immediate operational environment. While larger systems have been used to provide over-the-hill ISR capabilities on the battlefield for almost a decade, none deliver it directly to the squad level, where Soldiers need the ability to see around the corner or into the next room during combat missions.</description>

      <title>Fort Bliss completes latest testing of Force 2025 communications system</title>
      <author>Sgt. James Avery, 16th MPAD , SSG Christopher Blakeslee, 16th MPAD </author>
      <description>FORT BLISS, Texas -- The Brigade Modernization Command has completed their latest field test of the second increment of the Warfighter Information Network-tactical communication system, a Force 2025 initiative that will push real-time intelligence down to a maneuver brigade's company level for the first time. Network Integration Evaluation 15.1 is the eighth iteration of the semi-annual field test, in which 3,900 Soldiers and 1,200 government employees put multiple pieces of equipment through its paces in the rough Fort Bliss terrain, from Oct 3 to Nov. 4, not just to refine tactics, techniques and procedures for the equipment, but also to push the capabilities of the communication network to the limit.</description>

      <title>New technology to reduce Soldier's load</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Current and future developments in energy production promise to lower the Soldier's combat load and reduce the logistical footprint, said an Army systems expert. Current technology could allow Soldiers and their vehicles and equipment to one day passively capture solar energy, which will automatically charge batteries used for network communications and other tasks, said Maj. Mark Owens. Owens, a system coordinator at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics &amp; Technology, spoke at an Operational Energy forum today, in the Pentagon.</description>

      <title>Landpower forum: broad cooperation necessary for 'persistent influence'</title>
      <author>J.D. Leipold</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- In the last five decades, the world's population has almost tripled and people have been empowered through the Internet and other technologies, said the commander of Army Special Operations. Weapons that in the past belonged only to governments are now found in the hands of non-state actors and even individuals, said Lt. Gen. Charles T. Cleveland, USASOC commander. He said this requires not only conventional and Special Forces to work together, but explained "persistent influence" requires like-minded militaries and agencies to work together.</description>

      <author>Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Both the Army and America's adversaries enhance their prowess on the battlefield with technological innovation. But to be successful against an array of unknown enemies, the Army must focus not just on innovation, but on the speed with which it can deliver that innovation to Soldiers. Gen. Dave Perkins, commander of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, spoke Tuesday, at the Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition, here, about the recent release of the new Army Operating Concept, titled "Win in a Complex World -- 2020-2040."</description>

      <title>Shyu: Army modernization entering 'death spiral'</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- "This is a death spiral we're in now," said Heidi Shyu, assistant secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, describing the state of Army modernization. As the budget comes down and programs are extended, smaller quantities of items are purchased, driving up cost, she pointed out. Organic industrial workers are sitting on their hands with less work coming in. Small businesses that produce critical system components that the Army can no longer afford risk bankruptcy.</description>

      <title>Keeping it clean -- Natick's self-cleaning fabric technology goes commercial</title>
      <author>Jane Benson, NSRDEC Public Affairs</author>
      <description>Quoc Truong, a physical scientist at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, or NSRDEC, is making sure that it all comes out before the wash. Truong provided technical guidance and direction to NSRDEC's industry partner, Luna Innovations, Inc., to successfully develop a durable, "omniphobic" coating used to produce self-cleaning fabrics. The technology, which was developed for use in Soldier clothing, has now made its way to the commercial market. The coating greatly reduces how often Soldiers need to clean their clothes and enhances chem-bio protection.</description>

      <title>SMA Chandler addresses Soldier, family member questions during Fort Campbell visit</title>
      <author>Staff Sgt. Candice Funchess, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) Public Affairs</author>
      <description>With the current drawdown and budget restraints, can the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) still produce Soldiers ready to engage the enemy and win? "Absolutely." That was the response given by Sgt. Maj. of the Army Raymond F. Chandler III, when the question was asked during his visit to Fort Campbell, Sept. 3-5. Chandler came to meet with Soldiers and families to scout and hear what their issues and concerns were, in order to bring that information back to the Secretary of the Army John McHugh and the Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Ray Odierno. Chandler's visit began with a stop at the Warrior Transition Battalion for an overview of the Adaptive Reconditioning Program, and to meet with Soldiers within the program.</description>

      <title>Night turns into day: Army researchers enable night lethality</title>
      <author>Kim Bell, CERDEC NVESD Public Affairs</author>
      <description>In science fiction, technology problems are solved with the stroke of a writer's pen. In reality, science and technology research takes time, and a lot of effort. "If you've seen the movie Predator, you've seen a perfect illustration of the process of lethality," said Dr. Don Reago, director of the Night Vision Electronics Sensors Directorate, or NVESD, of the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center at Fort Belvoir, Va. "First, you must identify your target and if in fact it is a target, then you can move in and eliminate the threat."</description>

      <description>U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers with the 368th Engineer Detachment (Forward Engineer Support Team-Main), 412th Theater Engineer Command, successfully completed Virtual Battle Space 3 training while participating here in this year's Ulchi Freedom Guardian Exercise.

      <title>Righting a 44-year-old mistake: Vietnam hero to receive posthumous MOH</title>
      <author>Elizabeth M. Collins, Soldiers Live</author>
      <description>For one brief, excruciatingly hopeful moment, Evelyn Sloat thought the Army officers at her door were there to tell her that her son, Spc. 4 Donald P. Sloat, was coming home from Vietnam. Another local boy, one of Sloat's classmates, had been killed and Evelyn thought her son might have been assigned the grim task of escorting Edgar Pulliam Jr.'s body back to Coweta, Oklahoma. Coweta ultimately lost eight sons in Vietnam, and claims the highest per capita casualty rate in the nation for that war. And then she looked a little closer: The men at her door were in dress uniforms.</description>

      <title>Investing in the Army's future</title>
      <author>David McNally, RDECOM Public Affairs</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army vision for lethality science and technology investment is to enable overmatch in weapon systems for both offensive and defensive capabilities. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno said attaining overmatch is critical to the Army of 2025. "The Army has global responsibilities that require large technological advantages to prevail decisively in combat -- 'technological overmatch,'" Odierno wrote for the Army's official blog, in 2012. "Just as airmen and sailors seek supremacy in the air and on the seas, Soldiers must dominate their enemies on land. Modernizing, especially as end strength is reduced, is the key to ensuring that the Army's dominance continues."</description>

      <title>Future Fires: Integrating technology solutions</title>
      <author>David McNally, RDECOM Public Affairs</author>
      <description>Army leaders are looking to the future force and seeking to be revolutionary in their thinking about integrating technology, according to current guidance from the Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno. Department of Defense doctrine describes fires as the use of weapons systems "to create a specific lethal or nonlethal effect on a target. All fires are normally synchronized and integrated to achieve synergistic results," per Joint Publication 3-09.</description>

      <title>'Start Strong:' Every career in the Army starts with TRADOC</title>
      <author>U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command</author>
      <description>Through U.S. Army Recruiting Command, U.S. Army Center for Initial Military Training and U.S. Army Cadet Command, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command serves as the foundation for the "Start Strong" phase of every Soldier's career. U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, known as TRADOC, transforms civilians into Soldiers and provides them the pathway into the noble profession of Soldiers, past and present. For over 40 years, TRADOC has provided millions of Soldiers not only with the skills to become professionals in their field, but also the expertise and experience to successfully transition out of the Army upon completion of service.</description>

      <title>Army prepares for dangers lurking in 'deep future' megacities</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>Within about two decades, roughly 60 percent of the world's population will live in cities, particularly megacities of more than 10 million, according to a recent National Intelligence Council projection. Some of those inhabitants will be bent on terror and destruction of the regional and global community and the Army must be prepared to deal with that threat, according to Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, speaking at a media roundtable today. The roundtable was part of Exercise Unified Quest, which was conducted Aug. 17-22, which included a megacity disaster scenario set in what McMaster termed the "deep future," 2030 to 2040.</description>

      <title>War of 1812 part of Army's proud history</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>The failure to capture Canada, the retreat at Bladensburg, and the burning of the capitol 200 years ago this week are part of what people generally remember about the War of 1812, according to an Army historian. This largely forgotten war, however, was by-in-large a success for the U.S. Army, given the circumstances prior to June 1812, when the war started, according to Glenn Williams, U.S. Army Center of Military History. Williams edited a pamphlet, "The Chesapeake Campaign," which will be available in print or online by the middle of next month at http://www.history.army.mil/.</description>

      <author>Sgt. Quentin Johnson</author>
      <description>Leaders with the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment "Headhunters," 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, came together in competitive spirit for a leadership challenge here, Aug. 15. The leadership challenge was the first two-man team competition composed of each Headhunter company's platoon leader and platoon sergeant, said Lt. Col. Jason Tussey, Headhunter commander and originator of the competition. The day-long competition was comprised of several events, including a two-mile road march, weapons familiarization, advanced vehicle identification, call-for-fire and mission planning, said 1st Lt. Robert Koorn, Headhunter chemical officer and officer-in-charge of the challenge.</description>

      <title>SMA Chandler challenges USASMA students to think about future of Army, NCO Corps</title>
      <author>Jonathan Koester</author>
      <description>As Sgt. Maj. of the Army Raymond F. Chandler III spoke to the incoming class of the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy here, he challenged members of Class 65 to look to the future and decide what kind of Army and NCO Corps they want to have. "What do you want your Army to be?" Chandler asked. "As you look toward the future, what do you want your NCOs (non-commissioned officers) or your petty officers to be able to do?"</description>

      <title>Under Secretary challenges Army senior leaders to revamp civilian career management</title>
      <author>Audra Calloway, Civilian Worforce Transformation Program</author>
      <description>During a two-day session at the Pentagon last month, approximately 30 members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) gathered to discuss how to improve civilian career development. Army Under Secretary Brad R. Carson hosted the event, which was meant to help shape policy changes regarding how the Army hires, trains, develops, and sustains its civilian workforce. "Many civilians are expected to come to their jobs with the requisite skills and do not always receive the necessary training to advance their talents and careers," said Scott Rowell, Civilian Workforce transformation integrator.</description>

      <title>Wargame to examine the fall of a 'megacity'</title>
      <author>Maj. Erica Iverson, Army Capabilities Integration Center</author>
      <description>It's 2035, and a city of more than 10 million people is in a state of crisis plagued by insurgency, internal corruption and struck by a natural disaster in the form of a major flood. The challenges, opportunities and potential approaches for the U.S. Army to conduct operations in such a complex environment will be the focus of the Deep Futures Wargame, being conducted Aug. 17-22, at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. The wargame is the culminating event in Unified Quest 2014, the Army chief of staff's future study plan, which examines a variety of feasible mid- to long-range strategic and operational settings and explores a broad set of ideas about future conflict.</description>

      <title>Army taking steps to improve its CSM, SGM key-billet talent-management efforts</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>The Army has implemented changes to how it considers, selects and slates command sergeants major and sergeants major for the privilege of serving in Command Select List positions. For four years, the Command Select List, or CSL, system has filled the Army's most critical brigade and battalion-level CSM and SGM key billets with the best qualified senior NCOs. To optimize the CSL system, adjustments are being made so it continues to serve as a key tool in shaping the future of the Army, officials said.</description>

      <title>Smarter ground robots partnering with Soldiers</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>"In the Army, we always say, 'never send our Soldier into a fair fight.' Each of you here," from the robotics community, are "helping to make that happen," said Heidi Shyu, assistant secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics &amp; Technology. Shyu, who provided the keynote address at National Defense Industrial Association's Ground Robotics Capabilities Conference &amp; Exhibition here, Aug. 13, emphasized common architecture, open-source software and open standards for robotics development to further competition that will benefit the Army, taxpayers and industry. The Army is working with industry partners to develop a standard architecture which will enable us to incorporate future (robotics) capabilities rapidly, keeping pace with dramatic commercial improvements, she said.</description>

      <title>McHugh's attention on regionally aligned forces at Combined Resolve II</title>
      <author>Christian Marquardt, 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command</author>
      <description>Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh focused on the implementation of U.S. Army Europe's regionally aligned forces concept while observing Soldiers and NATO and European partners at exercise Combined Resolve II here, Saturday. "Regionally aligned forces better enable our Soldiers to collaborate with our European partners across the full spectrum of missions," said McHugh. "It's important for our Soldiers to have a continual engagement with our allies and partners." More than 4,000 participants from 14 NATO and European partner nations are participating in the largest scheduled multi-national exercise in Europe this year, and the Secretary spent the day learning about the challenges and benefits of training together as a coalition.</description>

      <title>Regionally aligned forces continue to organize despite budget uncertainties</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>As forces draw down from Afghanistan, more are available for regional alignment, said the Army's top forces generation leader. But unfortunately, total forces are also drawing down, limiting that manpower, added Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, commander, U.S. Army Forces Command, known as FORSCOM. Allyn and seven other panel members spoke Oct. 22, at a forum on regionally aligned forces, or RAF, at the 2013 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition at the Washington Convention Center.</description>

      <description>Senior leaders provided a snapshot of the challenges that the Army faces past 2020, during the 2013 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Exposition, in Washington, D.C. "In the last 12 years our Army has adapted remarkably well to the challenges we faced from Iraq and Afghanistan," said Gen. Robert Cone, Training and Doctrine Command, known as TRADOC, commander. "The challenge we face as we transition from an Army of execution to an Army of preparation is [that] we must reallocate some of our energy toward the future."</description>

      <title>Riggers support air drops in northern Iraq</title>
      <author>Staff Sgt. Shawn Nickel</author>
      <description>U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND AREA -- U.S. Army parachute riggers at two bases in the Central Command region are assembling pallets of food and water for humanitarian air drops in the vicinity of Sinjar, Iraq. The aid was assembled after the Iraqi Government sent a request for humanitarian assistance to displaced citizens through the Department of State. As of today, U.S. military aircraft had delivered more than 74,000 meals, ready-to-eat, known as MREs, and more than 15,000 gallons of fresh drinking water, to displaced Yezidis seeking refuge from Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorists.</description>

      <author>Capt. Peter Smedberg, 10th Mountain</author>
      <description>FORT DRUM, N.Y. -- As the Army begins moving toward reduced troop numbers, a glaring reality faces units across the board -- commanders must be prepared to sustain a rigorous operational tempo with fewer Soldiers standing in formation. To help shed some light on the future of the U.S. Army, Sgt. Maj. of the Army Raymond F. Chandler III and his wife, Jeanne, visited Fort Drum on Tuesday and Wednesday, to meet with Soldiers and family members and to talk about the Army's Ready and Resilient Campaign.</description>

      <title>Army hackers attack, protect Army network in preparation for Network Integration Evaluation</title>
      <author>Nancy Jones, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- As new technologies are introduced into the Army's network, they are evaluated during semi-annual, Soldier-driven operational exercises in the mountains and desert of Fort Bliss, Texas, and White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. Though the Soldier-executed test is the focus of these Network Integration Evaluations, know as NIEs, the overall success of the effort rests heavily on lab-based planning and integration testing back at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where months of risk reduction activities and evaluations are conducted prior to the operational event.</description>

      <title>Engineers developing safer, more accurate tracer round</title>
      <author>Audra Calloway, Picatinny Public Affairs</author>
      <description>PICATINNY ARSENAL, N.J. -- Engineers at Picatinny Arsenal are researching a way to develop a new type of tracer round that not only would perform its function during the day as well as night, but also improve shooter accuracy and keep Soldiers safer by reducing their visual signature. Tracer rounds, which are usually loaded as every fifth round in machine gun belts, provide essential information to Soldiers firing at an enemy target by creating a line-of-sight that allows them to track the trajectory of their bullets and adjust their aim. However, the pyrotechnic streak they emit also gives away the shooter's location by allowing the enemy to follow the line of pyrotechnic back to the shooter.</description>

For Copeland and many like him, life on the outside can look a little frightening.</description>

      <title>Network hotspot evolves with Soldier input</title>
      <author>Claire Heininger, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>ABDERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- The SNE is getting a mission makeover. The Soldier Network Extension (SNE), which delivers the Army's mobile tactical network backbone to the company level, is evolving from a vehicle used by the company commander to an information hotspot allowing other Soldiers to plug in, make phone calls and send and receive data from anywhere on the battlefield -- from an Afghan polling place to an air assault observation point. The changes, based on user feedback from Capability Set (CS) 13 fielded units and the Army's Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) events, are also making the SNE more user-friendly through major reductions in startup and shutdown times, a simplified graphical interface and improved troubleshooting tools.</description>

      <title>Leaders: Army aware, wary of IT challenges</title>
      <author>Libby Howe</author>

The Association of the United States Army Institute of Land Warfare hosted a forum Thursday, titled "The Future of Cyber in Support of Strategic Landpower." Throughout panel discussions at the event, experts emphasized the current vulnerability to cyber-attacks.</description>

      <title>Leaders: Network, cyber key to Force 2025</title>
      <author>Claire Heininger, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>ARLINGTON, Va. -- Networks and cyber are "the commander's business" today -- and will be fundamental to executing the vision of Force 2025, Army senior leaders said. From standing up a rapid acquisition cell for cyber capabilities to creating a standard network common operating environment, the Army is tackling the challenges of this evolving technical and operational landscape, while working closely with joint and industry partners to close capability gaps. The goal of these initiatives, senior leaders said, is to deliver a robust, versatile, integrated and secure network that will be fundamental to enabling a leaner, expeditionary Force 2025.</description>

      <title>Evolving Innovation: A new look at fostering cutting-edge thinking in Army science and technology</title>
      <author>Lt. Col. Joel Dillon, Dr. Jason Augustyn, Ms. Julia Kim and Mr. Dominic Ju</author>
      <description>Science and technology (S&amp;T) innovation is an uncertain road, with "failure" often a step on the path to a breakthrough. However, in a resource-constrained environment, planners must make the smartest possible investments of taxpayer money in S&amp;T programs, balancing risk with the potential for transformational new capabilities. A good place to start striking this balance is at the "fuzzy front end" of innovation, the initial period of exploration preceding the development of new materiel solutions. For many years, the acquisition community viewed the front end of innovation as a swirl of activity that occurs before Milestone A—a time of "eureka" moments and multiple return trips to the drawing board.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON -- Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. John F. Campbell took questions "virtually" from the field for an hour today, on a variety of subjects related to the Soldier for Life campaign. While Campbell is no stranger to live townhalls with Soldiers and their families, this was his first Facebook version of a town hall, and it allowed him to keyboard his answers from his desk in the Pentagon. It was also the first Soldier for Life town hall on Facebook. The vice chief opened the online town hall by answering, "What exactly is Soldier for Life?"</description>

      <title>Natick studies how fatigue affects Soldiers</title>
      <author>Alexandra Foran, NSRDEC Public Affairs</author>
      <description>NATICK, Mass. -- A new collaborative study at Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center looks at biomechanics and cognitive responses simultaneously to help determine how fatigue affects both the mind and body of Soldiers. Researchers at Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, known as NSRDEC, are testing Soldiers as they complete a prolonged march while carrying a load totaling 88 pounds. The Army is developing future predictive models of Soldier performance, including load carriage. "What we are striving to do with our current research is to identify the biomechanical markers at the onset of fatigue and supply data for validation purposes to analyze what happens to the Soldier over time during prolonged marching tasks," said Dr. Leif Hasselquist, NSRDEC biomechanist.</description>

The draft Request for Proposal, known as an RFP, which was posted May 21, to the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov, moves the Army toward Full Rate Production for the Rifleman Radio, part of the Handheld, Manpack, Small Form Fit program. Under the full and open competition approach, the Army will award contracts to multiple vendors, creating a "radio marketplace" where vendors will compete for delivery orders as needed, after they achieve technical and operational requirements.</description>

      <title>Army preps for first audit ever, says top finance leader</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>ARLINGTON, Va. -- Getting audited is something most taxpayers admit they dread. But those same citizens might be heartened to know that government agencies that receive their tax dollars are audited just the same, to ensure that money is properly spent. The Army and the rest of the Defense Department are on notice from Congress that they will be audited soon. Robert M. Speer, acting assistant secretary of the Army for financial management and comptroller, said the impending review is something the services should be looking forward to.</description>

      <title>Beefier carbines en route to Soldiers</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- A thicker barrel will absorb more heat in the new M4-A1 carbine, should a Soldier need to flip the selector to auto, according to Soldiers overseeing the new configuration now being added to the M4. While shooting in the automatic mode is less efficient and not as accurate as firing in bursts, it has its place on the battlefield, explained Command Sgt. Maj. Doug Maddi, Program Executive Office Soldier, Fort Belvoir, Va. "Soldiers need automatic capability while providing suppression fires during fire and movement," he said, noting that Soldiers deployed to Afghanistan asked for that and are now getting it, an option absent in the M4, which only fired in semi-automatic and bursts. A new drop-in trigger allows the A1 to function with the automatic setting.</description>

      <title>Vice Chief: Sustainment innovation key to Army of tomorrow</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>ARLINGTON, Va. (Army News Service, May 20, 2014) -- Logistics innovations are needed "to match the advances that we're trying to make with our combat forces," said Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. John F. Campbell. If those advances are not made, "we'll fall short of our strategic objectives," Campbell added during opening remarks at the Association of the U.S. Army's "Sustaining Force 2025" seminar here, today. Sustainment is in a critical period of transition, coming out of more than 12 years of war, he said. The past was marked by an over reliance on contractors doing maintenance work that Soldiers used to do, and a budget that could support it with overseas contingency operation dollars.</description>

      <description>FORT BLISS, Texas (May 19, 2014) -- Trading Beltway briefings for a Black Hawk and a backpack, Undersecretary of the Army Brad R. Carson visited what he described as one of the Army's premier installations to highlight one of the service's top modernization priorities, the tactical communications network. Less than a week after he was formally sworn in for his new position, the Army's second-highest-ranking civilian leader toured the site of the Network Integration Evaluation, or NIE, 14.2 here, Thursday, and reiterated the importance of a robust, flexible network to ensure information dominance for future missions.</description>

      <author>ECBC Communications</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- The U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center is researching and developing smoke screen compositions to keep pace with the changing face of conflict. The U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, known as ECBC, is currently completing a multi-year effort to refine several smoke screen compositions that will allow troops to mask themselves from enemy fire. A new formula will replace the World War II-era HC Screening Smoke Grenade. Offshoots have applications in short-range mortars, and long-range artillery shells. Joseph A. Domanico, senior engineer for the Pyrotechnics and Explosives Branch, leads the smoke composition effort.</description>

      <title>JIEDDO launches redesigned IED knowledge portal</title>
      <author>A.J. Bosker , Nikki Bournes</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Warfighters have a robust resource to help train for operating in environments plagued by improvised explosive devices. The Joint IED Defeat Organization, known as JIEDDO, Knowledge and Information Fusion Exchange, known as JKnIFE, provides training resources to prepare joint forces to successfully attack the improvised explosive device, or IED, network and future operating environments. "The goal of the leadership at JIEDDO is to deliver training that meets the learning objectives identified by U.S. Central Command and the JIEDDO Joint Center of Excellence," said Sgt. Maj. James Carabello, JIEDDO senior enlisted adviser. "Central to this is the ability for U.S. forces to recognize an emplaced IED under a variety of complex attack scenarios in the contemporary operating environment."</description>

      <title>Apache-UAV teaming combines 'best capabilities of man, machine'</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>NASHVILLE -- Apache helicopters, teamed with Gray Eagle and Shadow unmanned aerial vehicles, are a winning combo, according to Col. Thomas von Eschenbach. Apache AH-64E models, teamed with unmanned aerial vehicles, known as UAVs, are now increasingly performing the armed aerial scout missions, once performed by Kiowa helicopters, and, Eschenbach said, they're doing a fantastic job. Eschenbach, who is the capabilities manager, U.S. Army Training and Development Command, unmanned aircraft systems, spoke for a few minutes at the two-day Army Aviation Association of America, known as Quad A, 2014 Mission Solutions Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel, Monday. Then he opened up his "Future Manned/Unmanned Teaming" session for questions and comments from aviators.</description>

      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- It's hot. Humidity is near 100 percent, and you're in full combat gear -- including chemical-biological protection. Between your helmet and mask, your entire head is covered, leaving a sensation of suffocating heat. Sweat pours as you run, climb and crawl through enemy territory. How can you get through it? A fan blows soothing air across your face, under the tight-fitted mask.</description>

      <description>ADELPHI, Md. (May 7, 2014) -- Ronald Polcawich's first chemistry test in high school was "eye-opening." He still remembers the disappointment he experienced that day with a class of his peers, many of whom failed the test in Morgan Hezlep's class at Thomas Jefferson High School. He and two of his chemistry classmates, who remained connected after they had left the small West Jefferson Hills School District, have flourished in science careers. "It was not about the chemistry we learned that year, but the analytical thinking that started the journey," Polcawich said. "We left with an understanding of problem-solving."</description>

      <title>No Restructuring Commission Needed, Army Leaders Say</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON – The fiscal year 2015 Army budget submitted to Congress is "lean, stark, but critical to meeting the needs of our nation and our soldiers," said Army Secretary John M. McHugh said here yesterday. The budget reflects an adjustment of the force mix in favor of the reserve component, McHugh told members of the Senate Appropriations Committee during a defense subcommittee hearing on the Army budget. That budget and the accompanying force restructuring do not need to be examined by a commission, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told the panel.</description>

      <author>Lt. Col. Deanna Bague</author>
      <description>FORT BLISS, Texas -- Planning and training for Network Integration Evaluation 14.2 is well underway with the major events slated to start at the end of April and lead to the Joint Staff J-6 Bold Quest exercise. NIE 14.2 will focus on joint and coalition force integration, and allow assessment of communications and network gaps, with joint and multinational partners, said Lt. Gen. Keith C. Walker, deputy commanding general, Futures, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. To align with the military's principle of "training in the way it fights," one NIE 14.2 goal is to implement joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multinational operations in a realistic setting to examine interoperability and integration through sharing and safeguarding the right information.</description>

      <title>Vice chief: Army aviation needs its innovators to stay</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>NASHVILLE (Army News Service) -- Despite a shrinking budget and drawdown, Army aviation needs to retain its most valuable resource -- its bold and innovative Soldiers, said the Army's vice chief of staff. Those aviators are preparing the Army for its next fight, said Gen. John F. Campbell during his keynote address Monday, to the Army Aviation Association of America, known as Quad A, opening its two-day 2014 Mission Solutions Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel here. "While we may get smaller, we cannot sacrifice readiness and innovation," Campbell continued, citing innovations that occurred after past wars during drawdowns.</description>

      <description>PICATINNY ARSENAL, N.J. -- Picatinny engineers have devised improvements to the packaging of 60 mm smoke and illumination mortars that will save the Army money and allow Soldiers quicker access to the rounds during battles. "It's very simple," explained Lenny Freilich, lead 60 mm mortar packaging engineer with the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center, or ARDEC. "We've strengthened the metal container in order to remove some of the external packaging. The packaging inside the metal container remains exactly the same."</description>

      <author>Kathryn Bailey, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>PROVING GROUND, Md. -- Today's consumers enjoy both a common look and feel and interoperability between their computers, tablets and smartphones. Through recent advances in the Common Operating Environment, known as the COE, the Army is well on its way to providing these same capabilities to Soldiers. Whether accessing information on secure handheld devices, vehicle mounted systems or command post screens, Soldiers are beginning to see a "plug and play" experience similar to what has become the norm in daily home and office environments.</description>

      <title>Taking the long view of Army modernization means constantly staying ahead of technology</title>
      <author>Mr. Dale A. Ormond, Director, U.S. Army Research, Development And Engineering Command</author>
      <description>Most planning involves developing a series of concrete steps and conditional decision points that together define a good way ahead, and then—as no plan survives contact—adjusting that. As director of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), when I contemplate the Army's 30-year plan to modernize the force, I see our goal as not only to break that plan, but to break it often and before anyone else does. It is our job to make the Soldier's kit obsolete. This we must do if we are to help the Army maintain its unparalleled dominance on the battlefield.</description>

      <title>Soldiers have options to explore before Army restructure</title>
      <author>Marie Berberea</author>
      <description>FORT SILL, Okla. -- The Army is restructuring from 510,000 active-duty Soldiers to 490,000 in a number of ways. Natural attrition through End Term of Service dates is one, but there are also programs to make sure quality Soldiers stay in. "We may have Soldiers that are qualified to re-enlist, they meet that basic eligibility that we look for, but now we have to go a little deeper. And, even though they may be qualified, are they the 'best' qualified for continuous service?" said Sgt. Maj. Russell Paradis, Fort Sill command career counselor.</description>

      <title>DOD Releases Report on Estimated Sequestration Impacts</title>
      <author>American Forces Press Service</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON – Defense Department officials today released a report that documents the cuts to military forces, modernization and readiness that will be required if defense budgets are held at sequester-levels in the years beyond fiscal year 2015. The report fulfills a commitment made by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel "to provide details on the effects of these undesirable budget cuts," officials said in a news release announcing the report. The report says sequester level budgets would result in continued force-level cuts across the military services. The Army would be reduced to 420,000 active duty soldiers, along with 315,000 in the National Guard and 185,000 in the Army Reserve.</description>

      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- U.S. Army science advisors partnered with military, federal and state agencies to discuss their technology needs during an emergency response exercise, from March 27 to April 2. Alaska Shield simulated a 9.2-magnitude earthquake to test and improve preparedness. Exercise planners based the scenario on the earthquake that devastated south central Alaska in 1964. The exercise was a prime occasion for first responders to tap into the expertise of Army scientists and engineers, said Paul Thakur, a science advisor assigned to U.S. Army Alaska.</description>

      <title>Social media helping destabilize world, strategist says at War College</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Twitter, Facebook and other types of social media are contributing to global instability, said Robert D. Kaplan, chief geopolitical analyst for Stratfor -- a team of intelligence experts. The use of social media, he explained, has been shown to unite and rally demonstrators at a moment's notice, enabling them to focus their energies on toppling regimes in just a matter of days. An example would be the use of it during the so-called Arab Spring, which began in December 2010. Kaplan was keynote speaker at the 25th Annual Strategy Conference in Carlisle, Pa., sponsored by the Army War College, in partnership with the Joint Staff/J7.</description>

      <title>NIE 14.2 to assess coalition force integration by teaming with Bold Quest</title>
      <author>Lt. Col. Deanna Bague</author>
      <description>FORT BLISS, Texas – Planning and training for Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 14.2 is well underway. The major events start at the end of April and lead to connecting with the Joint Staff J-6 Bold Quest exercise. NIE 14.2 will focus on joint and coalition force integration, and allow the assessment of communications and network gaps, with joint and multinational partners, said Lt. Gen. Keith C. Walker, deputy commanding general, Futures, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, and director, Army Capabilities Integration Center. To align with the military's principle of training how they fight, one of the NIE 14.2 goals is to implement joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operations in a realistic setting to examine interoperability and integration by sharing and safeguarding the right information.</description>

      <title>TRADOC relooking NCO education with eye to 'adaptation' </title>
      <author>Gary Sheftick</author>
      <description>FALLS CHURCH, Va. -- The Army is conducting a complete re-assessment of its NCO education system for the first time since 1976, said the general who just took the helm of Training and Doctrine Command. Gen. David G. Perkins, who assumed command of TRADOC on March 14, spoke at the Army's Brain Health Consortium, Thursday, at the Defense Health Headquarters. The ultimate weapon of the U.S. Army in the future must be the brains of its Soldiers, Perkins said. "We're banking on our cognitive capability," Perkins said, describing that as the Army's "ace in the hole" against potential enemies.</description>

      <title>Students armed with science spark Soldiers' interest</title>
      <author>Lt. Col. Deanna Bague</author>
      <description>FORT BLISS, Texas – Soldiers with the Brigade Modernization Command and 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, who helped judge the 5-STAR Innovation Cup STEM Showcase and Competition, in which middle and high school students displayed their concepts and products in science, technology, engineering and math, said they were highly impressed with what they saw. "Some of the kids operate at a really high level," said Capt. Vuong Do, an intelligence integrator for BMC's Brigade Modernization and Integration Division. "The concepts that these [students] were able to come up with, how they put it together, how they displayed it and how they presented it was really amazing. I can't imagine being back in school and myself even, doing the same thing that these guys are doing."</description>

      <title>Army testing combat boots, camouflage patterns</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>FORT BELVOIR, Va. -- Young Soldiers often want to wear a uniform that looks cool, while lawmakers want cost effectiveness, but the Army's priority is protecting the Soldier from harm. That's what Col. Robert F. Mortlock, project manager for Soldier Protection and Individual Equipment, Program Executive Office Soldier, said he aims for, along with other important goals like comfort, fit, price, protection from the environment and durability. As the Army pivots to the Pacific region, it is looking to develop a new jungle boot. Testing of some vendor-supplied prototypes could begin this summer, Mortlock said. A good jungle boot, he explained, would shed water, meaning it can dry out fast after submersion.</description>

      <title>Army outlines network modernization priorities</title>
      <author>Army CIO/G-6</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- The Army chief information officer/G-6 outlined priorities for network modernization as the Army plans for Force 2025. "The Army continues to focus on building IT capacity and increasing bandwidth speed by a thousand times," said Lt. Gen. Robert Ferrell, who became the CIO/G-6 in December 2013. "We are greatly improving operations and training at posts, camps, and stations and for deployed organizations," Ferrell said. "More IT capacity and speed enables home-station mission command; split-based operations; and live, virtual and constructive training."</description>

      <title>Is the DoD Innovating? How the New Budget Stacks Up</title>
      <author>Paul Scharre</author>
      <description>As the Pentagon faces inevitable budget cuts, "innovation" and "adaptation" are the buzzwords of the day, but are they reality? The recent Department of Defense (DoD) Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) identifies innovation as a core theme, and Department leaders have gone to great lengths to stress that they have chosen to protect key investments for the future, even in lean times. The capability areas that DoD says it is protecting—cyber operations, special operations forces, and development of a new long-range bomber—indeed make sense strategically and will be extremely useful in future operating environments. DoD has also stressed that it is maintaining research and development funding in order to retain the U.S. military's technological edge.</description>

      <title>101st Airborne advances training with Army network</title>
      <author>Claire Heininger, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. -- As they prepare for their first large-scale air assault exercise since before 9/11, the Soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) are not just getting "back to basics" with their core mission -- they are using the Army's new tactical network to take it to the next level. In April, the 3rd Brigade Combat Team and other elements of the 101st Airborne Division will conduct Operation Golden Eagle, a four-day training event focused on executing the expeditionary air assault mission and updating the doctrine that supports it, known as the Gold Book. New to that fight are many personnel whose experience centers on counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as Capability Set 13, a package of communications systems that provides digital situational awareness down to the lowest echelons of the force.</description>

      <title>From '1984' to 2025: Army, industry focus on next-generation network</title>
      <author>Claire Heininger, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- Thirty years ago, Apple introduced the Macintosh computer with a splashy Super Bowl commercial and the bold promise that information technology could change the world -- if it was easy to use and accessible by all. Now, the Army wants to unlock the same potential for its next-generation tactical communications network. From touchscreens and mission apps for Soldiers to wireless networking for command posts, Army senior leaders today outlined their vision for a powerful, yet simple to operate tactical network designed to support both a more expeditionary force and a generation of Soldiers who are digital natives. "We absolutely must change," said Brig. Gen. Daniel P. Hughes, program executive officer for Command, Control, Communications-Tactical, or PEO C3T, the organization that provides the Army's tactical network.</description>

      <title>This QDR Is a Budget Document, Not a Strategy Document</title>
      <author>Kori Schake</author>
      <description>Secretary Hagel claims that the fiscal year (FY) 2015 defense budget "matches our strategy to our resources…Our updated defense strategy," that is. Updated because the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff memorably said the defense strategy could not be executed if a single dollar was cut from the budget, right before Congress cut about $50 billion of them. The only update in this Quadrennial Defense Review from earlier strategic guidance looks to consist of narrowing the force-sizing demand to defeat a regional adversary while "imposing unacceptable costs" on another. Otherwise it's all the usual about the world becoming more volatile, global connectedness, building partner capacity, rebalancing to Asia without diminishing effort anywhere else, the need for "exceptional agility" in our forces and efficiencies in the defense effort.</description>

      <title>Army at 'tipping point' of unmanned aircraft system capabilities</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- "We're on the tipping point of unmanned aerial systems' ability to deliver capability to the Soldier," said Col. Thomas von Eschenbach. The unmanned aerial/aircraft system, or UAS, is no longer seen by Soldiers as a new system and as the months and years pass, it will "not just be used by a few, but will become integral to the Army fabric and how it fights and is used and understood," said Eschenbach, who is the UAS capability manager for U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Eschenbach and others spoke today at a media roundtable at Redstone Arsenal, Ala., where a celebration was held marking the Army's milestone of 2 million UAS flight hours. Col. Timothy Baxter, project manager, UAS, noted that it took 20 years for Army unmanned aircraft systems to reach 1 million flight hours.</description>

      <title>Army studies using technology to improve logistics</title>
      <author>Dan Lafontaine, RDECOM Public Affairs</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- A National Research Council, or NRC, committee studying ways to reduce the size of the Army's logistical demands met with Research, Development and Engineering Command experts recently to look at technologies that may help the Army reach that goal. Jyuji D. Hewitt, deputy director of Research, Development and Engineering Command, known as RDECOM, led the command's team of experts who presented in person as well as via video teleconference from locations across the country. "The NRC study group's focus is technologies that have the potential to reduce logistics requirements and meet sustainment requirements in the Army through 2020 and beyond in support of the Joint Force Commander," Hewitt said. "If you look at the size of the force, it's about one-third combat power and two-thirds combat support.</description>

      <title>Social media antics can ruin career, misrepresent military services</title>
      <author>Amy Perry</author>
      <description>FORT LEE, Va. -- Social media is very pervasive these days. As a new generation of Soldiers -- all well-versed in the various aspects of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter -- join the ranks, senior leaders across the installation are taking steps to ensure these troops realize the impact of their online chatter. Col. Mary Beth Taylor, 23rd Quartermaster Brigade commander, and Col. Thomas Rivard, 59th Ordnance Brigade commander, both oversee organizations that are responsible for training and preparing thousands of Soldiers each year to move on to their first duty stations. Teaching the new troops about using social media responsibly is among their top priorities.</description>

      <title>Combatant commanders: National Guard builds global partnerships, proven on battlefield</title>
      <author>Sgt. 1st Class Jim Greenhill</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON - The National Guard builds enduring global partnerships and is proven on the battlefield, combatant commanders told Congress here Wednesday. Two of the combatant commanders also said they would like to see more National Guard State Partnership Program relationships in their areas of responsibility. "We have eight states that are over in [the National Guard] State Partnership Program," Army Gen. David Rodriguez, commander, U.S. Africa Command, told members of the House Armed Services Committee during a hearing on the 2015 defense budget. "They perform a great role in building relationships, as well as building capacity of our partners," Rodriguez said.</description>

      <title>AWTC helps enhance operational readiness</title>
      <author>Lt. Col. Sonise Lumbaca</author>
      <description>FORT A.P. Hill, Va. (March 5, 2014) -- The Asymmetric Warfare Training Center, or AWTC, is a facility that was built to support the Army's Asymmetric Warfare Group's mission to identify capability gaps and provide rapid solution development within various complex operational environments. Solutions can range from adding a piece of equipment to a kit or developing tactics, techniques and procedures. These operational environments can vary by region and can entail challenges as diverse as subterranean conditions to the destructive impacts of a natural disaster. The AWTC is also a venue that provides tailor-made training scenarios and environments for the AWG, the Army and Joint Forces, and other government organizations.</description>

      <title>Army network boosts speed, simplicity during test</title>
      <author>Amy Walker and Claire Heininger, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. -- With drastically reduced startup and shutdown times, a new, easy to use graphical interface and improved troubleshooting tools, the Army's mobile tactical network backbone system recently completed a key test. In line with the Army's overall effort to simplify the network so it more resembles technology that Soldiers operate in their daily lives, the changes to Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, or WIN-T, Increment 2 reflect a network that is easier to operate and maintain. "We want an 'on' switch for the network -- we want it to be absolutely transparent to Soldiers," said Brig. Gen. Daniel P. Hughes, program executive officer for Command, Control, Communications-Tactical, which manages the WIN-T program.</description>

      <title>Army continues to expand body armor analysis work to protect Soldiers</title>
      <author>Joyce M. Conant, ARL Public Affairs</author>
      <description>ADELPHI, Md. (March 3, 2014) -- Researchers from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory continue to expand body armor analysis work to protect Soldiers - not only protecting their lives, but also their daily life functions after treatment and recovery. The team of researchers in the Warfighter Survivability Branch of ARL's Survivability Lethality Analysis Directorate implements methodology to better understand and analyze the protective capability of body armor, both in terms of mitigating injury and life changing outcomes. For example, eye injuries have a low level on the threat to life scale but are very significant in terms of quality of life and the Soldier's ability to perform military tasks. The addition of new injury outcome metrics provides a method of scoring and quantifying protection in multiple meaningful dimensions.</description>

      <description>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- Leaner but still mean -- if not meaner -- is the future of the Army in 2025, and the time to prepare for that future force is now. "We have a consensus and an opportunity, and really a need, to move ahead very quickly as we look at Force 2025," said Gen. Robert Cone, commanding general of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Cone mapped out that path forward for attendees of the Association of the United States Army's 2014 Winter Symposium in Huntsville, Ala., as he spoke on Force 2025, Thursday.</description>

      <description>KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia, – Former U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program bobsledder Steven Holcomb and Team USA civilian brakeman Steve Langton became the first U.S. athletes in 62 years to win a two-man bobsled Olympic medal by taking the bronze at Sanki Sliding Center here last night. They secured the medal aboard the USA-1 sled with little room to spare -- finishing only 0.03 seconds ahead of the fourth-place duo of hosts, the Russians Alexander Kasjanov and Maxim Belugin, who finished with a four-run cumulative time of 3 minutes, 46.30 seconds.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON -- Fewer dollars means that for Army aviation to remain relevant and ready, it will need to better partner with industry and its sister-services, become more flexible and expeditionary and equip its squadrons with the best intelligence tools it can afford. That was one assessment posited during a panel discussion at the Association of the United States Army's Aviation Symposium, Jan. 15, in Arlington, Va. Despite a shrinking budget, Army aviation will continue to become even more valuable to commanders and Soldiers on the ground through its investment in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or ISR, sensors and software, said panel member Lt. Gen. Mary A. Legere, deputy chief of staff, Army G-2.</description>

      <author>Greg Mueller</author>

      <title>Performance Triad warm-up changes prepare body to perform</title>
      <author>Staff Sgt. Christopher Klutts</author>
      <description>JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash. -- The Army substituted static stretches for the more dynamic Preparation Drill with the introduction of the Physical Readiness Training program. Now, the Performance Triad -- a holistic approach to well-being that incorporates sound sleep and nutrition practices with safe physical activity -- encourages Soldiers to prepare to perform every time they hit the gym, not just during unit physical training. Maj. Daniel Rhon, a physical therapist at Madigan Army Medical Center on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, said preparing properly puts the body in "prime condition" for strenuous physical activity.</description>

      <title>Army fields 101st Airborne new tactical network with integrated training approach</title>
      <author>Nancy Jones-Bonbrest, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. -- With the Army's newest set of tactical network systems now in the hands of Soldiers who could be among the last to deploy to Afghanistan, the service is ensuring users master the power behind their communications gear. To do this, the Army established a new System of Systems, or SoS, training concept drawing on lessons learned from previous units fielded with the integrated communications package known as Capability Set 13, or CS 13, including two brigade combat teams, known as BCTs, of the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) that are now deployed to Afghanistan. The new approach embraces instruction on integrated systems capabilities, leverages Soldier knowledge and creates an underlying familiarity with how the equipment supports operations.</description>

      <title>Army newest recovery vehicle wields claws that can handle most anything</title>
      <author>T. Anthony Bell</author>
      <description>FORT LEE, Va. -- The Ordnance School is continuing to fulfill the training requirements of Soldiers deployed in combat environments. Providing training on the Army's newest recovery vehicle -- the Modular Catastrophic Recovery System -- is its latest effort to prepare Soldiers for tasks and missions they are likely to encounter in the field. The Modular Catastrophic Recovery System, or MCRS, which is currently fielded only in Afghanistan, is a multi-component recovery system that has been used in Southwest Asia for several years. The Ordnance School implemented the MCRS module into the H8 Recovery Specialist Course, a three-week Additional Skill Identifier course, in October of 2012.</description>

      <description>FORT GORDON, Ga. - The network is under attack! Cyber attacks are a daily reality and are growing in sophistication and complexity.

      <title>Energizing base camps of the future</title>
      <author>Bob Reinert, USAG-Natick Public Affairs</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON -- Unless Congress acts to counter the effects of sequestration, the Army will be hard-pressed to complete its mission, said the service's senior officer. "If Congress does not act to mitigate the magnitude, method and speed of the reductions under the Budget Control Act with sequestration, the Army will be forced to make significant reductions in force structure and end strength," said Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Ray Odierno. "Such reductions will not allow us to execute the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, and will make it very difficult to conduct even one sustained major combat operation."</description>

      <title>Soldier input aids Army researchers</title>
      <author>Jake Dorsey, Northwest Guardian</author>
      <description>JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash. (Sept. 27, 2013) -- When Army researchers needed feedback on a new combat vehicle, they went to the real experts -- the users. They visited experienced brigades -- including 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, a Stryker brigade combat team at Joint Base Lewis-McChord -- to get the opinions of Soldiers whose lives could depend on the new vehicles and equipment.</description>

      <author>Joyce P. Brayboy, U.S. Army Research Laboratory</author>
      <description>What if Soldiers could convert JP-8 to clean hydrogen fuel for fuel cell applications anywhere and anytime they need it? A small team of scientists at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory are collaborating with counterparts at the Communications-Electronics and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Centers, to develop technology for lightweight, portable prototype systems that would convert Jet Propellant 8, commonly referred to as JP-8, to hydrogen on the spot.</description>

      <title>AWG prepares soldiers for adaptive leadership at Risk Reduction Exercise, NIE 14.1</title>
      <author>Lt. Col. Sonise Lumbaca, Army News Source</author>
      <description>Picture a small confined space beneath the earth's surface that potentially goes on for miles in complete darkness. The oxygen supply, height and distance of the space, and its physical layout are unknown. Operability of communications and equipment within the location is unknown. Enemy composition, disposition and strength are unknown. These are a few of the challenges that soldiers must consider when faced with conducting operations within a subterranean environment.</description>

      <title>Training emphasizes 'new normal,' integrates military readiness, civilian deployments</title>
      <author>Capt. Olivia Cobiskey</author>
      <description>Two men approached Pfc. Terrance Rogers as he and his men secured the building where civilian and military personnel were meeting with village leaders. Rogers smiled while he used hand signals and the little bit of Dari he'd learned in training to ask the men questions about their families and Afghanistan. He kept them engaged long enough to allow the meeting between personnel from the Department of State, Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Agency for International Development and local village leaders to conclude.</description>

      <author>Claire Heininger and Amy Walker</author>
      <description>The Army's new, mobile tactical communications network has reached Afghanistan, where U.S. forces are relying on the technologies to stay connected and cover more ground.

      <title>Vice chief addresses current Army challenges</title>
      <author>C. Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>While budget cuts and sequestration are a challenge, Americans won't accept them as an excuse for the Army failing to maintain a fighting force able to win the nation's wars, said the Army's vice chief of staff. "They don't want to hear that sequestration makes our job hard," said Vice Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. John Campbell. "If they ask us to do something, our nation expects us to be able to do it."</description>

      <title>'Talisman Saber' shows Army's expanding role in Pacific</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>I Corps is playing a key role in Exercise Talisman Saber in Australia, demonstrating the Army's increasing influence in the Pacific, said one of the exercise planners. Many associate the Navy with the Pacific, but no one lives on the ocean," said Lt. Col. Jade Hinman, deputy plans officer for I Corps. "They live on the land," and that's where the Army's significant capability comes into play.</description>

      <title>Soldiers Train Under Fire Aided by Army's New Network</title>
      <author>Amy Walker</author>
      <description>As a U.S. Army platoon in training heads into a quiet mock Afghan village, an improvised explosive device detonates in its path; Soldiers on foot dodge swarms of insurgent gunfire. Because the unit is equipped with new Capability Set 13 network technologies, the location of each Soldier and details of the fight can be sent to commanders throughout the entire brigade, who can quickly send in needed support and put their next move into action.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Army: Maintaining a Balanced Force</title>
      <author>Jacqueline Hames</author>

Troops are returning home in a time of fiscal uncertainty, which presents additional challenges to the force-balancing effort. Whether it's integrating women into combat units, developing leaders or balancing the budget, senior leaders want Soldiers to know the Army is prepared for whatever demands lie ahead.</description>

      <author>David Vergun</author>

John M. Cho, a doctor, and deputy chief of staff for operations with Army Medical Command.</description>

      <author>C. Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>As the Army cuts the number of Soldiers in its ranks, there will be an excess of infrastructure in place that used to support those Soldiers. Maintaining that extra unused infrastructure could mean other critical Army programs will suffer, said a senior official.</description>

      <description>Change and innovation have been constants at Fort Benning since Congress first authorized the creation of then Camp Benning in the fall of 1918.

Eisenhower plus notable four-star generals like George Patton and Colin Powell.</description>

      <title>Better Information Improving Army Readiness Decisions</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>Commanders not only need to know the current state of unit readiness, they'd also like to know where those readiness levels will be in six months or 10 years. Enterprise Management Decision Support, or EMDS, has only been operational since 2010. Currently, the EMDS system draws from about five years of historical data and from about 20 databases. A lot of the data comes from the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army and the Army Operations Directorate.</description>

      <description>Secretary of the Army John McHugh said a RAND study showed it would be more cost effective to shut down the Abrams tank plant in Lima, Ohio, than to continue production. The money, he said, needs to go to other modernization and readiness efforts. Shown here, Soldiers training in South Korea in their Abrams tanks.</description>

      <description>For Staff Sgt. Stephen Kovac, getting important information and instructions to the rest of his platoon was a struggle. He could radio back to higher headquarters and wait for the calls to filter back down, losing precious seconds during an operation. Or, he said, he could "yell and scream back to the rear, use hand and arm signals, anything possible to get it across."</description>

      <title>Budget Cuts Will Affect Readiness, Army Leader Says</title>
      <author>C. Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>The Army's under secretary said with sequestration in place and deep cuts requested, the Army is concerned about how it can train, equip and sustain Soldiers to be ready when called upon. Under Secretary of the Army Joseph W. Westphal, Ph.D., was on Capitol Hill early morning April 18, to have breakfast with and address a delegation of civic leaders from Lawton, Okla., that had come to the nation's capital to meet with their senator. Lawton is the civilian community outside Fort Sill. That military installation is home to more than 50,000 Soldiers, civilian employees and military family members.</description>

      <title>Leaders Emphasize Importance of Human Domain as Army Plans for Future</title>
      <author>Justin Tang</author>
      <description>It is fitting that on the 10-year anniversary of the Iraq War, the Army gathered Joint Force partners, civilian military experts and foreign military representatives to analyze the lessons learned from more than a decade of war to help guide the service's transition to an Army of preparation. The Army's senior leaders gathered at the National Defense University on Fort McNair for the 2013 Campaign of Learning's Senior Leader Seminar, an event hosted by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno to plan for the Army's future, facilitate discussion among top military experts, and capture lessons learned from several years of war.</description>

      <title>Army studies range from virtual marksmanship to waste water reuse</title>
      <author>C. Todd Lopez</author>
      <description>Army commands can start thinking now about submitting study proposals to the Army Study Program Management Office for consideration this summer. Meghan Mariman, director of the Army Study Program Management Office, known as ASPMO, which is part of G-8 at the Pentagon, said that each year, her office pays for about 30 studies at the request of Headquarters, Department of the Army agencies and Army-level commands.</description>

      <title>How the Army Needs to Lead Transformation in the Operational Energy Campaign</title>
      <author>Chief Warrant Officer 4 Ronaldo M. Lachica</author>
      <description>The Army defines operational energy (OE) as "the energy and associated systems, information and processes required to train, move, and sustain forces and systems for military operations." OE includes electricity required by Army installations for daily activities, the fuel required to operate vehicles and generators for training and contingency operations, and even the batteries Soldiers carry in their rucksacks to operate various electrical devices.</description>

      <title>Leaders: Army Network Evaluations to Adapt, Endure</title>
      <author>Claire Heininger</author>
      <description>The Network Integration Evaluations, or NIEs, which have already yielded enhanced network capabilities for select brigade combat teams deploying to Afghanistan, are now adapting to encompass scenarios posed by other theaters and the regional alignment of forces, as well as joint and coalition operations. At the same time, the NIE business model -- using a single brigade combat team to conduct integrated evaluations for government and industry systems in a realistic operational environment -- will remain an enduring avenue to fill emerging capability gaps.</description>

      <title>NIE: Delivering Capabilities to Today's Soldier.</title>
      <author>Lt. Col. Deanna Bague</author>
      <description>What does today's Soldier need? Still in its evolutionary state, the Network Integration Evaluation continues to make progress in achieving greater cost benefits and in streamlining the process of getting capabilities into the hands of Soldiers quicker. Network Integration Evaluations, known as NIEs, were designed to integrate and mature the Army's tactical network through a series of semi-annual evaluations that brought a fundamental change in the rapid fielding of Army capabilities.</description>

      <description>The Army has partnered with the automotive industry and others in an effort to jump-start the development of more energy-saving and high-performance vehicles. Most of these efforts are still in the research and development stages, but "our initial analyses (for future adaptation) are very promising," said Katherine Hammack, assistant secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment.</description>

      <description>Gen. Robert W. Cone, commanding general of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, hosted a town hall forum to share information directly with the TRADOC civilian workforce, Feb. 7, at Jacob's Theater on Fort Eustis. "I have learned during my time in the Army that communication is critical when you are going through a tough situation or are dealing with a lot of uncertainty," Cone said. "I may not have all of the information you want at this time, but I want to make sure that we all have a shared view of the situation."</description>

      <title>Combat Veterans Refresh Unmanned Aircraft Skills</title>
      <author>Sgt. Michael MacLeod</author>
      <description>Infantry Capt. Joseph Driskell ended his recent deployment to Afghanistan using unmanned aerial vehicles differently than when he began. One thing he realized that unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, training is critical. "It's like anything. It takes practice," he said. Five months after his battalion of paratroopers redeployed from restive Ghazni Province, its UAV operators began retraining on their piloting skills in one of western Fort Bragg's many wide-open parachute drop zones during a week-long refresher course.</description>

      <title>CSA's Strategic Intent: Delivering Strategic Landpower in an Uncertain World</title>
      <author>Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. Raymond Odierno</author>
      <description>Over the past 11 years of continuous combat, the Army made great strides at the tactical and operational levels of war. We evolved our tactics, fielded new equipment, and modified our organizations, all while combating determined enemies. These changes were necessary, and they produced an Army without peer on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. However, they do not fully prepare us for the diverse array of challenges our nation faces in the coming years. Changes in the character of modern conflict demand that we continue to evolve as an institution, even as we remain focused on our primary task -- to fight and win our nation's wars.</description>

      <title>Army Advances Two Airborne Radios</title>
      <author>Nancy Jones-Bonbrest, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>As the Army continues to advance its new tactical radio strategy, it is building on lessons-learned from the Joint Tactical Radio System program to drive innovation in radios for service aircraft.  Following the recent Department of Defense decision to disband the Joint Program Executive Office for Joint Tactical Radio System, known as JTRS, and transfer its programs to the services, the Army is now responsible for two software-programmable radios with the technology to connect rotary wing aircraft with ground units, allowing the transmission of data, voice and video over the wireless, secure network.</description>

      <title>CSA Warns of Budgetary 'Perfect Storm'</title>
      <author>J.D. Leipold, Army News Service</author>
      <description>Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno said the greatest threat to America's national security is fiscal uncertainty and potential shortfalls that could "hollow" out the force. Odierno spoke Jan. 24 to a packed house of Association of U.S. Army members during a monthly Institute of Land Warfare breakfast meeting. He said the Joint Chiefs of Staff penned a letter to House and Senate leaders Jan. 14 voicing their concerns over future readiness of the armed forces and stating that three budget conditions are creating a "perfect storm."</description>

      <title>Corps of Engineers Completes Army's Largest Solar Array Installation</title>
      <author>James Campbell, USACE</author>
      <description>The largest solar power system in the U.S. Army is coming online at White Sands Missile Range, N.M., and officials gathered Jan. 16, to mark the occasion with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Energy Savings Performance Contract, or ESPC, project, awarded and managed by the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, provides the sprawling desert base with a new 4.465 megawatt solar photovoltaic system, guarantees energy savings of 35,358M British thermal units per year, and reduces their energy consumption by 10 percent, said Wesley Malone, Huntsville Center project manager.</description>

      <title>TRADOC Sees Role of Army Aviation Growing While Force Downsizes</title>
      <author>J.D. Leipold, Army News Service</author>
      <description>With a smaller, leaner force in the future, aviation will play a bigger and more significant role than it has over the last decade, said the Army's Training and Doctrine, or TRADOC, commander. Speaking before members of the Association of the U.S. Army today at its annual aviation symposium and exposition, Gen. Robert W. Cone said the risks associated with a smaller Army can be mitigated by continuing investments in aviation and by finding balance between near-term and long-term readiness of the force.</description>

      <title>Army to deliver fuel-efficient generators to Afghanistan</title>
      <author>Nancy Jones-Bonbrest, PEO C3T</author>
      <description>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. (June 12, 2012) -- The U.S. Army will soon field its next generation of operational energy to Afghanistan with a line of leaner, fuel-saving generators expected to transform the way power is delivered to the battlefield. Known as Advanced Medium Mobile Power Systems, or AMMPS, the generators cut fuel consumption by as much as 21 percent and free up Soldiers from fuel convoys often targeted by roadside attacks.</description>

      <title>Test systems using alternative fuel source</title>
      <author>Mr. John Andrew Hamilton (ATEC)</author>
      <description>Test systems on White Sands Missile Range are using new alternative fuel options for better, cleaner, long term power. Utilizing fuel cell systems provided under an Operational Test Command, Army Test and Evaluation Command program test systems on WSMR have already been equipped with clean burning methanol fuel cell systems. Fuel cells, ranging in size from that of a small lunch box up to larger units about the size of a foot locker can be used to power things like communications relays, instrumentation, and data collection packages required for test operations. The cells convert methanol, a type of alchohol, into electricity.</description>

      <description>
        Soldiers from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division flew through the sky as part of a forced entry air assault jump into hostile territory before setting up a perimeter, securing their forced landing and unleashing full-scale combat operations upon battle enemies – all as part of an ongoing Army exercise at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.

      <title>Army opens 20,563 engineering positions to women</title>
      <author>David Vergun</author>
      <description>
        WASHINGTON (Army News Service, June 19, 2015) -- Military Occupational Specialty, or MOS 12B, Combat Engineer is now open to all female enlisted Soldiers of all components, according to Army Directive 2015-27.

        The June 16 directive from Army Secretary John M. McHugh makes available 20,563 additional positions for women and opens the last of the 16 engineer MOSs, which were closed to women. The only positions not open to women in engineering are in certain special operations units.

        Female officers were previously assigned as combat engineers "to provide a support network for junior female Soldiers and to offer advice to the unit's male leadership," said McHugh, who signed Army Directive 2014-16, June 17, 2014, making that happen.

      <title>Four Myths That Drive (and Endanger) U.S. Defense Policy</title>
      <author>Janine Davidson</author>
      <description>U.S. defense planning has evolved since the mid 1970s, with the end of the Vietnam War and the founding of the All-Volunteer Force (AVF). Since then, at least four troubling myths have become baked into doctrine, strategy, and force planning processes. These beliefs focus on our strengths, but have in some ways blinded us to the enduring nature of conflict.</description>

      <title>Unmanned systems a growing threat to U.S. forces</title>
      <author>Kathleen Curthoys</author>
      <description>Huntsville, Ala. — Unmanned aerial systems in enemy hands are among the Army's greatest war-fighting challenges, experts said at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition. Dr. David E. Johnson of Rand Corp., during a Tuesday panel, cited the group Hezbollah flying two UASs into Israel a few years ago. "This is the beginning of a huge problem for all of us," Johnson said.</description>

      <title>TRADOC Commander to Army Acquisition: Buy Capabilities, Not Things</title>
      <author>Valerie Insinna</author>
      <description>HUNTSVILLE, Alabama — The Army is venturing into a rapidly changing and unknowable future,and will need to invest in capabilities that help it seize advantages over its enemies, the commanding general of U.S. Training and Doctrine Command said March 31. That may require a change in the way the Army acquires technologies, said Gen. David Perkins during a speech at the Association of the U.S. Army's global force symposium and exposition. The focus of acquisition should be building capability to win, not simply buying a desired thing, he said.</description>

      <title>AWA Is NOT NIE: Army Tries To Buy Weapons That Work</title>
      <author>Sydney J Freedberg Jr</author>
      <description>HUNTSVILLE, ALA: After 20 years of costly and cancelled programs, the US Army wants to break its weapons-buying system wide open. This time, service leaders swear, will be different from previous, failed reforms. The pinnacle of the new process will be something called the Army Warfighting Assessment, an annual wargame at Fort Bliss, Texas that's intended to put innovative new technology in the hands of real soldiers in field conditions.</description>

      <title>Army Sees Rapid Prototyping as Key to Rapid Innovation</title>
      <author>Matt Cox</author>
      <description>U.S. Army science and technology leaders want to use rapid-prototyping equipment more often to help bring innovation to the battlefield faster. Increasing the pace of innovation has been a popular topic this week at the Association of the United States Army's winter meeting. Army technology experts and defense industry officials have discussed ways to simplify and improve how capabilities are developed, focusing on keeping costs down in the early days of testing until after technology is fielded.</description>

      <title>Army Changing How It Does Requirements: McMaster</title>
      <author>Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON: After two decades of procurement disasters, the Army is finally overhauling how it buys new weapons. The service is starting with a difficult test indeed: the new light armored vehicle to provide mobile protected firepower to the 82nd Airborne and other light infantry forces — a role unfilled since the temperamental M551 Sheridan retired in 1997. Building what's basically an air-droppable tank has bedeviled the service for decades.</description>

      <title>Full Speed Ahead On Wargames: Gen. Odierno</title>
      <author>Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.</author>
      <description>ARLINGTON: The US Army is trying to reinvent itself, much as it did during the Great Depression. Even if the steep cuts called sequestration return in 2016 — as is current law — the Army would rather get smaller than shortchange innovation, Chief of Staff Ray Odierno said today. The service will hold annual wargames on new ways of fighting, Gen. Odierno said, the first of them this August on the concept formerly known as Air-Sea Battle.</description>

      <title>New US Concept Melds Air, Sea and Land</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON — The Pentagon's five-year-old Air-Sea Battle concept is undergoing a major rethink as it opens its focus to incorporate input from the land services and combatant commanders, senior Joint Staff and Navy planners told Defense News on Jan. 22. The effort to expand the predominantly Navy and Air Force-heavy concept kicked off last fall when the Joint Chiefs made a recommendation to Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey to open it wider to the other services. Dubbed the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC), the emerging plan "is not trying to replace Air-Sea Battle with Joint Access and Maneuver, and it's not 'throw the Air-Sea Battle concept out and start all over again,' " said Navy Capt. Terry Morris, deputy director for Air-Sea Battle in the Pentagon.</description>

      <title>New Video Game Could Speed Up Acquisition Timelines</title>
      <author>Yasmin Tadjdeh</author>
      <description>ORLANDO, Fla. — By the time a piece of military equipment is fielded, it has already reached a point where it would be extremely costly to make soldier-recommended alterations. An Army-led initiative called synthetic prototyping hopes to collect that troop feedback earlier in the acquisition process in order to save time and money. ESP is a synthetic game environment that lets soldiers evaluate emerging technology and provide feedback, said Lt. Col. Brian Vogt, a simulations operations officer at the Army Capabilities Integration Center.</description>

      <description>Two influential service organizations are imploring Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) to "remove the specter" of sequestration for the Army. "The continued effects of sequestration on the Department of Defense will cause the Army, Active, Guard and Reserve to fall into unreadiness," wrote retired Gen. Gordon Sullivan, president and CEO Association of the U.S. Army, and retired Maj. Gen. Gus Hargett, president of the National Guard Association, in a letter sent this week. The sequester, "with its rigid implementation, does not provide Army leaders the funding certainty or financial flexibility to responsibly structure, fund and maintain the Army of the future," they warned.</description>

      <title>The Army Weighs Options for Migrating Apps to the Cloud</title>
      <author>Nicole Blake Johnson</author>
      <description>The Army is serious about tackling application sprawl and identifying systems that can move to government data centers and commercial cloud environments. So far, the Army has identified 62 applications that are ideal for hosting in the cloud, said Michael Krieger, deputy CIO/G-6, following an AFCEA event Monday on the future of Army IT programs and priorities. The service will move applications to the Defense Information Systems Agency's milCloud or to commercial cloud vendors cleared to host the Army's most sensitive data classified at levels five or six, Krieger told FedTech.</description>

      <author>Matt DiLallo</author>
      <description>Energy security is a priority for the U.S. Army, as many of its installations are at the end of the power line. These bases stand to lower power if anything happens to the electric grid. This has been an increasing concern for the Army, which has seen a four-fold increase in power disruptions over the last decade. There is also a real worry that cyberthreats to the power grid could impact the Army's ability to keep its bases up and running.</description>

      <title>NIE Introduces New, Earlier Cyber Elements</title>
      <author>Rita Boland</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army is introducing new cyber features into its semiannual Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) to better identify, understand and defend against threats. Cyber considerations will be introduced earlier in the process at the laboratory in Aberdeen Proving Ground before technologies hit the ground at the event itself. For the first time, the federated labs on the campus of Aberdeen's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, or C4ISR, campus will take a coordinate system-of-systems approach to lab-based risk reduction.</description>

      <description>The U.S. Army may not be ready to let soldiers access a wide-range of military data on their personal smartphones and tablets, but that has not stopped officials from expanding bring-your-own-device [BYOD] use in key areas. Today, soldiers who want to access training and educational content must do so using Windows-based devices, Helen Remily, with the Army's Training and Doctrine Command [TRADOC], told the Army News Service.</description>

      <title>Army working on taking the drivers out of its vehicles</title>
      <author>Jeff Gould</author>
      <description>The Army and Marine Corps are pursuing futuristic driverless vehicle technology that would free troops to do other things like watch for ambushes and roadside bombs. The military is on the road to 2025, the notional date for Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center to roll out tactical vehicles that drive themselves as part of the Autonomous Mobility Applique System. The effort is taking a page from commercial automakers working on cars that stay in their lanes and navigate traffic with nobody driving, and Google, which says it plans to field such a car in 2017.</description>

      <title>Army building a marketplace for tactical comm equipment</title>
      <author>Kevin McCaney</author>
      <description>In support of its push toward seamless frontline tactical communications, the Army is creating a one-stop shop for tactical communications hardware. The marketplace will fall under the umbrella of the Common Hardware Systems program office, which has for more than 25 years provided a portfolio of commercial technologies that meet the Army's technical requirements. As it does with other equipment, CHS will establish the technical standards—and a contract vehicle—for hardware used to support the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE), the Army said.</description>

			<title>Major General Herbert Raymond McMaster</title>
			<author>Dave Barno</author>
			<description>Major General Herbert Raymond McMaster might be the 21st century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker. Recently tapped for his third star, H.R. is also the rarest of soldiers — one who has repeatedly bucked the system and survived to join its senior ranks. He initially gained renown as a cavalry commander, earning a Silver Star in 1991's Gulf War after his nine tanks wiped out more than 80 Iraqi tanks and other vehicles. His reputation grew after his 1997 book, Dereliction of Duty, boldly blasted the Joint Chiefs for their poor leadership during Vietnam.</description>

      <title>Virtual reality gets real with Army's 3D game update</title>
      <author>Kevin McCaney</author>
      <description>The Army is getting more real with its 3D training game, Virtual Battle Space 3, by creating avatars that match the strength, endurance and skills of the users rather than letting them take the virtual field in the shape of a sinewy virtual super warrior. The game, known as VBS3 for short, has added human dimension modeling with which soldiers enter their own height, weight, Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) scores and their weapons qualifications scores, the Army said in a release. The result is a more realistic virtual reality experience. If a soldier is overweight, the avatar will look dumpy. If he's not in the best of shape, he will get tired more quickly. If she's not qualified to use a particular weapon in real life, she can't use it in the game.</description>

      <title>Fast and Light: US Army Overhauls Its Gear Strategy</title>
      <author>PAUL McLEARY</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON — The US Army is putting the finishing touches on a bold new strategy for how it prepositions stocks of critical equipment around the globe, how it uses those stocks to speed deployments — and who pays for it. Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno ordered the revised strategy last year as part of his vision to make the service more capable of deploying quickly to meet threats, and assist in humanitarian and disaster relief missions. And a key element of the plan is to pass off some of the cost of using and resetting the equipment to the combatant commanders. "What we want is for [advanced positioned stocks] to be a part of the theater, a part of the plan, a part of the combatant commander's thinking, a part of the allies' thinking," as opposed to being a static reserve, one senior officer said.</description>

      <title>U.S. Defense Policy in the Wake of the Ukrainian Affair</title>
      <author>George Friedman</author>
      <description>Ever since the end of the Cold War, there has been an assumption that conventional warfare between reasonably developed nation-states had been abolished. During the 1990s, it was expected that the primary purpose of the military would be operations other than war, such as peacekeeping, disaster relief and the change of oppressive regimes. After 9/11, many began speaking of asymmetric warfare and "the long war." Under this model, the United States would be engaged in counterterrorism activities in a broad area of the Islamic world for a very long time. Peer-to-peer conflict seemed obsolete.</description>

      <title>Wireless Network for Army Brigades Too Complex, Burdensome</title>
      <author>Sandra I. Erwin</author>
      <description>Army officials have decided to hit the pause button on current efforts to equip combat brigades with wireless communications networks. They are recalibrating their plans after it became clear that the current systems are too esoteric and exceedingly difficult for Army units to maintain in the field. Three combat brigades have been equipped with a new information network of sensors, software and radios that the Army has been assembling since 2011. Senior leaders have been emphatic that a 21st century battlefield network — with all the bells and whistles that are available to civilians in the information age — would be the Army's highest modernization priority.</description>

      <title>Army Plans to Buy New Small Drone</title>
      <author>Valerie Insinna</author>
      <description>The Army wants to procure a new small unmanned aircraft which will be packaged as a kit along with the RQ-20 Puma and RQ-11 Raven. The short-range micro unmanned aerial system will be a part of the Army's family of small UAS, said product manager Lt. Col. Nick Kioutas. "We don't know what the short-range micro ... is going to look like, but it's probably some sort of a quadcopter," he said. "The soldier can take that out and land it somewhere and continue to get video feeds. We call it perch-and-stare capability."</description>

      <title>Where do Apache helicopters belong?</title>
      <author>Walter Pincus</author>
      <description>This one is over the Pentagon's plan to cut costs by moving the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters assigned to Army National Guard units to the active Army and replacing them with newer UH-60 Black Hawks, which are used mainly for transportation. Where the Apaches end up "remains a contentious issue," said Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.), chairman of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, as he opened a hearing March 27 on the Army's portion of the 2015 defense appropriations bill. "We know this is controversial, but we believe we have no choice," said Army Secretary John McHugh, who understands the problem for legislators. He is a former Republican congressman from New York who was once the ranking minority lawmaker on the House Armed Services Committee.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering Overseas Force Structure</title>
      <author>Irv in The Bridge</author>
      <description>Now may be a good time to reconsider further reductions in U.S. overseas force structure in Europe and Asia. Though not the proximate cause, the events in Ukraine imply a loss in the deterrent ability of the United States. While it may be too late to maintain a large deterrent force in Europe, there may be a lesson for the United States with regards to current and near-term force structure and posture decisions. This is especially true for the U.S. Army.</description>

      <title>Recent Events Validate Two War Strategy And Appropriate Force Structure</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>Since it came into office, the Obama Administration has done its best to do away with the central premise of U.S. defense strategy and force sizing: the requirement to be able to fight two conventional wars in different parts of the world at about the same time. First, the administration decided that it would no longer size U.S. ground forces for long-term, large-scale stability operations, in other words a repeat of Iraq and Afghanistan. In and out is the new plan, regardless of what kind of mess we leave behind. Then, there was the decision to downsize our response to a second contingency.</description>

      <title>How you can leverage the Army NIE program</title>
      <author>Peggy Miller</author>
      <description>For the Army Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) program the past year has represented a year of change and at times, debate. The twice-yearly event focuses on shortening the cycle time of technology acquisition, driving cost savings, and more rapidly placing innovative capabilities in the hands of warfighters. As is the case with many military programs, budget cuts and evolving priorities put into question the frequency and financial support for NIE. Program introspection is a good thing, and that is in part what makes NIE unique.</description>

      <title>Putin, Crimea And The Need For U.S. Land Forces In Europe</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>A specter is haunting Europe; it is the specter of land war. The emerging conflict in Europe is about nationalism, the control of territory and the domination of populations, precisely the kind of fight we were told was passé in the 21st century. The massing of Russian forces along that country's border with Ukraine is reminiscent of the lead up to Soviet aggression throughout the 40-year-long Cold War. Like that period, the security of the Ukraine and the easternmost members of NATO cannot be guaranteed by airpower alone.</description>

      <title>Army to Equip Soldiers With New Sensors for Night Targeting</title>
      <author>Sandra I. Erwin</author>
      <description>The wars of the past decade exposed weaknesses in Army technology for infantry troops. Close-combat equipment such as night vision goggles and weapon sights are bulky and drain batteries fast. In bad weather and darkness, soldiers want better visibility so they can correctly identify targets. They also want to be able to aim their weapons without exposing themselves to enemy fire.</description>

      <description>The failures of American will exposed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine are numerous and mounting. Coming on top of the tepid response to China's declaration of an air defense identification zone over Japanese waters and the withdrawals from Iraq, Afghanistan, and the "red line" in Syria, they have revealed Barack Obama as a man who not only "leads from behind" but marches to the rear. In some ways, however, critiques of Obama's weakness may be as revealing of America's new strategic timidity as the president's policy. Take, for example, Charles Krauthammer's recent "How to Stop Putin" essay in the Washington Post.</description>

      <title>New Sensor Protects Army Helicopters From Small Arms</title>
      <author>Kris Osborn</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army is in the early phases of a fleet-wide technology upgrade of its Common Missile Warning System, or CMWS — helicopter sensors that can provide detection against small arms fire in addition to missile threats. So far, the Army has ordered 1,300 CMWS Generation 3 systems, technology which improves the processing power of the original system to add small arms fire detection technology, said Bill Staib, director of threat management solutions, BAE. The existing or prior CMWS technology, now installed across the Army's helicopter fleet of Apaches, Chinooks, Kiowas and others, places five ultraviolet sensors around the skin of the aircraft in order to detect incoming missiles. The sensors are connected to an on-board computer, called an electronic control unit, which then helps the helicopter change course to avoid the missile or send out flares to divert the incoming threat off course.</description>

      <title>US Army Working With Joint Chiefs to Develop 'Global Landpower Network'</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON — Preparing for the start of a series of hearings before Congress to discuss his fiscal 2015 budget, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno struck a cooperative tone in remarks at a Washington think tank Thursday, stressing joint solutions to future conflicts. The chief unveiled what he called the Global Strategic Landpower Network, which he said is being discussed among the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The idea is new, but Pentagon discussions about the concept revolved around "a multinational network that would be established around the world that enables us to respond" to contingencies, and a "multinational joint capability," he said. Army staffers and other Pentagon officials contacted for more information either did not respond to queries by press time or were unfamiliar with the discussions.</description>

      <title>Wearable Computers Closer to Combat Use</title>
      <author>Dan Parsons</author>
      <description>Much like the iPod beginning around 2002, Google Glass is slowly becoming a common modern fashion accessory. The device immediately splashed across the Internet and television, then randomly showed up on subways and in coffee shops. Soon rumors circulated that the private sector had solved the wearable-computer conundrum the U.S. military has tackled for years. Then, in February, the commander of all Navy ships in the Pacific Ocean took to a stage in San Diego with the wearable computer strapped to his head.</description>

      <title>How Big Will the US Army Be in 2019? Not Even the Army Knows</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>— Just as the budgeting office of the US Army was preparing to submit its fiscal 2015 budget, last-minute word from the White House turned everything on its head. The original 2015 budget, along with the forward-looking future years defense plan (FYDP) for 2016-2019, called for the Army to fall to 420,000 soldiers by 2019, a significant cut from the 490,000 soldiers the Army is slated to field by the end of 2015. But after being apprised of those numbers, the White House entered the fray "very late in the cycle," according to Brig. Gen. John Ferrari, the Army's deputy director of program analysis, and told the service that it would be able to keep 440,000 to 450,000 soldiers if Congress voids sequestration in 2016. If not, the 420,000 number would be implemented.</description>

      <title>Why the Garrison State Is Here to Stay</title>
      <author>Pete Harris</author>
      <description>On its face, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's recent announcement that the U.S. Army is to be downsized to pre-World War II levels makes eminent sense. In fact, many consider such a move to be long overdue. The United States today faces no geopolitical threat comparable to that posed by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in the 1940s or the Soviet Union during the Cold War, while America's long stretch of fighting its "wars of choice" in Iraq and Afghanistan is now ending under President Obama's leadership. Why, then, is it already conventional wisdom that the Pentagon's 2015 budget will be opposed in Washington for being overly austere?</description>

      <title>Tiered Readiness Returns In Army 2015 Budget; Not All Brigades Ready to Fight</title>
      <author>Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.</author>
      <description>PENTAGON: Last year, the sudden budget cuts known as sequestration forced the Army to cancel crucial training for 78 percent of its combat brigades. The budget request for 2015, released today, buys back a lot of that lost readiness — but not all. In fact, the Army has now officially resigned itself to what it once said it would never do: a system of readiness haves and have-nots, in which some units are never fully trained. That's something the Army Vice-Chief of Staff, Gen. John Campbell, admitted was on the table when he talked to me in August, but now "tiered readiness" is the official Army plan.</description>

      <title>NIE Successes for Small Businesses</title>
      <author>Rita Boland</author>
      <description>As the U.S. Army's Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) continues to build on its positives and address its challenges, progress is being made in acquiring more capability from small business through efforts at the event. An official with the service branch says the Army is aware of challenges faced by these smaller companies. With the recently established formal request for proposal (RFP) process in place, industry partners including small businesses can compete for contract awards to provide qualifying vendors with funding to participate in the evaluations. The NIE touts three success stories with small businesses where capabilities have transitioned to program managers: a technology by Ringtail Design to enhance the common operating picture, a consolidated mobile mast platform by Blue Sky Mast and PacStar's IQ Core software.</description>

      <title>Army 2015 Budget Kills GCV, Cuts Readiness</title>
      <author>Matthew Cox</author>
      <description>Army budget officials presented the service's fiscal 2015 budget today, a spending plan that cuts readiness, kills the Ground Combat Vehicle and places a new priority on replacing obsolete vehicles such as the Humvee and the M113 armored personnel carrier. Steep defense spending cuts under sequestration have forced the Army to adopt strategy that focuses on near-term readiness, a move that will restrict training for many combat units, shrink aviation assets and delay high-priority modernization efforts, Army Maj. Gen. Karen Dyson, director of the Army budget office, said during a March 4 Pentagon briefing.</description>

      <title>How much Army is enough?</title>
      <author>Michael O'Hanlon</author>
      <description>The Pentagon's new strategy calls for an active-duty Army of 450,000 soldiers — the fewest number of full-time soldiers since before World War II. That would be just 10% less than the average since the mid-1990s to halfway through the Bush years — not a huge change. Marines and Army Guardsmen and Reservists would be cut slightly less, in percentage terms. Even so, how much is enough?</description>

      <title>Army May Expand Network Integration Evaluation Exercises</title>
      <author>Valerie Insinna</author>
      <description>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — In order to get the technologies it will need by 2025, the Army needs a bigger exercise with broader troop participation than the current Network Integration Evaluation, said the commander in charge of forming doctrine for the service. The NIE events seek to test out new tactical equipment and rapidly deliver it to soldiers. The next set of exercises — held twice yearly at Fort Bliss, Texas — are scheduled for spring. The service is still working out what the objectives of a new exercise — currently called Force 2025 Maneuvers — would be, which units would be involved and where it could take place.</description>

      <title>Cutting the Army will make it stronger</title>
      <author>Michael Desch</author>
      <description>Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has fired a shot across the bow of business-as-usual at the Pentagon by announcing significant cuts in the U.S. Army. Trimming the active component of the Army from 580,000 to 450,000 would hardly take us back to the interwar Army of 280,000 that gave birth to great wartime leaders like Dwight Eisenhower, George C. Marshall, George A. Patton or Douglass MacArthur, but it still represents a significant reduction in manpower. It undoubtedly will start World War III on the Hill and among other elements of what Ike referred to as our "military-industrial complex," but Hagel should hold the line as the time is ripe for an audacious move on this front. He should stand by these cuts for three reasons.</description>

      <title>Army Solicits Industry For Simple, Scalable Training Technologies</title>
      <author>Valerie Insinna</author>
      <description>Army officials in January laid out a wish list of what they would like to see in future simulation technologies, including straightforward systems that can train entire brigades and require fewer personnel to facilitate exercises. More details on training, leadership development and education gaps will be forthcoming at a June industry day, said Brig. Gen. Michael Lundy, then the deputy commanding general at the Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., during a panel at the Association of the U.S. Army Aviation Symposium and Exposition. "We're not asking anybody to come and show us stuff. We're going to tell you what we need you to do," he told an audience of defense contractors.</description>

      <title>Industry Melds Smartphones to Rifles</title>
      <author>Dan Parsons</author>
      <description>The U.S. military has long sought technologies that improve soldier effectiveness in combat, particularly ones that enhance situational awareness, communication and marksmanship. The Army continues to struggle with development of its next-generation battlefield communications network, and the Defense Department's shadowy research arm is seeking a foolproof robotic sniper scope. Meanwhile the commercial firearms industry seems to have already outdone both. It was evident in January at the SHOT Show in Las Vegas that the commercial firearms industry has found solutions to those problems by using relatively inexpensive commercial, off-the-shelf technology.</description>

      <title>The Army Bets Big On The Future And On Its Soldiers</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army has withstood a barrage of criticism from defense experts over the past ten years or even twenty years, including from me. The central thrust of these criticisms has been the Army's difficulty in adapting to changes in the security environment and in technology. As a result, there is a meme that sees the Army as repeatedly playing catch-up with respect to emerging threats such as IEDs or new capabilities like mobile phone networks. As a result, Army acquisition has often shown signs of what might be characterized as "bureaucratic bipolar disorder," on the one hand jumping from one trendy idea to another but, on the other hand at times moving so slowly on major acquisition programs that they were rendered obsolete by newer technologies or changing strategic circumstances.</description>

      <description>The Worst Policy is to Attack Cities. Attack Cities Only When There is No Alternative. Sun Tzu, Art of War. Convinced that Hitler would employ whatever forces were necessary to seize the city [Stalingrad]...the sole function of the [Soviet 62nd &amp; 64th Armies] was to lure combat ready German forces into the city..., sap their strength in the kind of street combat for which German soldiers were neither trained nor accustomed to fighting.</description>

      <title>U.S. Army Combat Vehicle Plans Careen From Heavy GCV To "Stryker Lite"</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>What is it with the U.S. Army and its inability to manage major acquisition programs? The history of Army acquisition over the last twenty plus years is littered with failed attempts to define, develop and build new armored fighting vehicles and tanks. Does anybody remember the Future Combat System (FCS), the system of systems which promised to deploy a set of lightly-armored vehicles that would rely on superior situational awareness and mobility rather than armor for survival? The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) is what emerged from the collapse of the FCS.</description>

      <title>What Is the Asia 'Pivot'? Depends on Who's Talking</title>
      <author>JOHN T. BENNETT</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON — The most striking aspect of the exchanges between senior Pentagon officials and lawmakers Tuesday was the rhetoric about the so-called "Asia pivot." The two sides might not have such a full-blown disconnect that it will hamper policy creation and fund allocation regarding an increased US focus in China's backyard. But, in public at least, the executive and legislative branches have emphasized different issues.</description>

      <title>Budget constraints force Army to make tough choices about modernization</title>
      <author>Jared Serbu</author>
      <description>The Army's top officer said affording all the pieces and parts of the service he is currently charged with manning, training and equipping can no longer be done over the long term. So Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said it's time to cut back on not just people, but platforms too. Because of the budget levels mandated by the Budget Control Act over the next decade, the Army plans to bring down the size of its force as quickly as it can without doing so in a way that would actually cost more money than it saves.</description>

      <title>Why Is Battlefield Communications Gear So Bulky? Army Chief Asks</title>
      <author>Bob Brewin</author>
      <description>Battlefield communications gear is unsustainably cumbersome compared to commercial cellphone technology, according to Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno. "I can sit here in my chair and pull out my smartphone and talk to every continent in the world with one little smartphone," Odierno said at a breakfast meeting of the Association of the U.S. Army last Thursday. When it comes to battlefield communications, he said, "I have to bring 50 trucks and 300 soldiers. Why is that? We cannot do that anymore. Our command and control systems are too heavy today."</description>

      <title>Army looks to virtual training, shared intell amid budget cuts</title>
      <author>Amber Corrin</author>
      <description>Amid stagnant budgets and declining force size, Army leaders routinely stress the need to maintain readiness. Finite funding has placed a greater emphasis on simulation, virtual environments and shared platforms for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in helping prepare soldiers for the next war. The Army is planning to collapse at least three virtual programs into a single environment that encompasses integrated, across-the-board training, according to Army officials speaking last week at the AUSA Aviation symposium in Arlington, Va.</description>

      <title>US Army Leaders Preview Lighter, Faster Service</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON — Taken separately, several speeches, briefings and interviews conducted by US Army leadership over the past two weeks don't necessarily look like anything special. When viewed as a whole, however, one can see a developing strategic narrative at work as the service — which is suffering more under sequestration and Pentagon cutbacks than the other services — tries to adjust to a time of relative scarcity after a decade of big budgets padded liberally with wartime supplemental funds.</description>

      <title>Army expanding, streamlining tactical network</title>
      <author>Kevin McCaney</author>
      <description>The Army's push to expand the reach of tactical network communications has made steady progress toward the goal of extending to soldiers in the field, but that expansion also has increased the complexity of the network. The answer? Increase capacity while simplifying the network. The first increment of the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical provided voice, data and video communications to the battalion level. WIN-T, Increment 2, deployed in late 2012, took on–the-move communications to the company level, but also increased the number of nodes on the network fourfold.</description>

      <title>Smaller military plans for a nimble, expeditionary future</title>
      <author>Tom Vanden Brook</author>
      <description>What would a smaller military look like and how would it fight? USA TODAY reported over the weekend that the Army has been told to plan to lop off 100,000 soldiers if the automatic budget cuts known as sequestration continue until the end of the decade. Army brass are coming to terms with what a force of 420,000 could and could not. do. It has about 530,000 soldiers now. The other services will be taking hits, too, according to a senior Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details are not public.</description>

      <title>Army readiness problems will persist through 2020</title>
      <author>Jared Serbu</author>
      <description>The budget agreement lawmakers reached last month will go some way toward alleviating the pain of sequestration for the Army. But even with that relief, it will be 2020 before the service digs its way out of the military readiness problems sequestration caused, the service's top officer said Tuesday. The Ryan-Murray budget agreement softens the blow of sequestration to the Pentagon mainly by giving the military services more time to prepare for the budget levels mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act. In 2014, instead of having its budget capped at $498 billion, DoD will be able to spend $521 billion.</description>

      <title>Sensor Allows Troops to Collect Infrared Images from Vehicles</title>
      <author>Valerie Insinna</author>
      <description>Ground forces are continually looking for ways to increase situational awareness on the go, but collecting live video from a moving vehicle can often be tricky in rough terrain that jostles sensors and cameras. Falck Schmidt Defense Systems and Raytheon have partnered to launch the long-range reconnaissance and surveillance forward looking infrared system, a mast-mounted sensor installed on a wheeled or tracked vehicle. Denmark-based defense contractor Falck Schmidt developed the mast. Raytheon manufactured the FLIR, a variant of its long-range advance scout surveillance system.</description>

      <title>US Army Studying Replacing Thousands of Grunts with Robots</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON — The postwar, sequestration-era US Army is working on becoming "a smaller, more lethal, deployable and agile force," according to Gen. Robert Cone, head of the service's Training and Doctrine Command. But just how much smaller might come as a surprise. During remarks at the Army Aviation Symposium in Arlington, Va., on Jan. 15, Cone quietly dropped a bomb. The Army, he said, is considering the feasibility of shrinking the size of the brigade combat team from about 4,000 soldiers to 3,000 over the coming years, and replacing the lost soldiers with robots and unmanned platforms.</description>

      <title>Gen. Grass: Budget Deal Gives Guard, Army Time To Compromise</title>
      <author>Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.</author>
      <description>The chief of the National Guard Bureau, Gen. Frank Grass, testifying to Congress last year on the impact of sequestration. As budgets tighten, will the National Guard and the regular Army go to war? Not if Gen. Frank Grass, chief of the National Guard Bureau, can help it. Peppered with questions about the conflict today at the National Press Club, Grass carefully redirected almost every one. In fact, he said, December's last-ditch budget deal to delay sequestration gives the two components time to resolve the potential conflict with a painful but rationally agreed-on compromise.</description>

      <title>US Plans Radical Upgrade of Stryker Brigades</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>If the Army can manage to keep its future budgets in line with current projections, the service will transform all nine of its Stryker brigades into the heavily armored "double V-hull" (DVH) configuration. The Army already fields two DVH brigades while a third is in the works to be fully equipped by the end of fiscal 2016. That's the good news. The not-so-good news is that the remaining six brigades remain unfunded in fiscal 2016-2020 budget projections obtained by sister publication Defense News.</description>

      <title>The Army Goes to Sea</title>
      <author>Rajiv Chandrasekaran</author>
      <description>ABOARD THE USS LAKE ERIE — Approaching from the Hawaii coast, the helicopter buzzed around this guided-missile cruiser twice before swooping toward the landing pad. The Navy crew on the deck crouched, the helmeted faces betraying more than routine concern as the aircraft, flown by a pilot who had never before alighted upon a ship, hovered a foot off the tarmac and then set down with a thud. The sailors' trepidation was prompted by three words painted in black block letters on the drab olive fuselage: United States Army. The Army, which fights on terra firma, does not usually land its helicopters on ships — the domain of the Navy and the Marine Corps — but these are not usual times in the U.S. military.</description>

      <title>Government-issued Apple, Android phones and more coming in 2014</title>
      <author>Joe Gould</author>
      <description>For years, Army mobile phones came in one variety — BlackBerry — but the Defense Department in 2014 plans to catch up with the mobile revolution by offering Android, iOS and Windows mobile devices too. The plan is to add 100,000 devices by October, and as many as 300,000 within three years. "There's chocolate, vanilla and strawberry in the ice cream store, pick the flavor you want," the Army CIO/G-6's mobility lead, Rick Walsh, told Army Times. "It's not just vanilla anymore." The move, which is part of the Defense Department's device agnostic mobile strategy, means soldiers with government-issued smartphones will have access to a broader array of apps and capabilities, while competition among the manufacturers of these devices is expected to drive down costs, Walsh said.</description>

      <author>Rose L Thayer</author>
      <description>The commander of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command called on local military supporters to help him spread the word about the importance of increasing America's focus on strategic land power. "It's very important people understand the role the U.S. Army plays in the triad," said Gen. Robert Cone, who leads the command known as the architect of the Army's future. "We need to start to talk about and think about the virtue of strategic land power. ...Land is where we win wars in history, and where we'll win wars in the future."</description>

      <title>The Army Wants Soldiers to Wear Solar Panels and Bionic Knee Braces</title>
      <author>Colin Daileda</author>
      <description>When United States soldiers venture out on routine three-day missions in the field, they mostly pack the essentials: food, water, ammunition and 10 to 13 pounds of batteries. Modern soldiers have so many electronically-powered devices, from night vision goggles to flashlights to radios, that batteries are a vital component of their livelihood. In fact, they have to carry so many batteries that the weight impedes mobility. The occasional demand for a resupply means more soldiers must risk their lives just to deliver batteries to other military members in need.</description>

      <title>Fuel-Efficient Engine to Increase Range, Power of Army Helicopters</title>
      <author>Valerie Insinna</author>
      <description>During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, Black Hawk helicopters were regularly flown at higher altitudes and in hotter temperatures than their engines were designed to withstand. With underpowered engines in those conditions, each helicopter could only carry five soldiers at a time — about half of an 11-person squad. The Army over the next decade plans to phase out legacy equipment and introduce a new, more powerful engine that will be able to take a full squad twice as far, all while burning less fuel. Through the Improved Turbine Engine Program, or ITEP, the service will replace the T700 engines that power its Black Hawk and Apache helicopters.</description>

      <author>Walter Pincus</author>
      <description>Can you provide a computerized system that automatically performs name comparisons and also can detect relationships with other names? Can you design a platform that accesses the news media from anywhere in the world, mines it for files of interest and then provides real-time operational data from it to multiple stakeholders? And while you're at it, maybe you can resolve massive real-time and historic filed data sets and automatically extract results from trillions of such records? If so, the U.S. Army wants to hear from you.</description>

      <title>Laser Weapons Are Finally Here, but Future Remains in Doubt</title>
      <author>Sandra I. Erwin</author>
      <description>A laser beam the size of a quarter fired from the back of a truck successfully shot down football-size mortar rounds and took small drones out of the sky. In the world of directed-energy weapons, this was a milestone achievement, government and industry officials said. It happened between Nov. 18 and Dec. 10 during tests of the Army "high energy laser mobile demonstrator" at White Sands Missile Range, N.M. Laser beams that can replace bullets and missiles have been a tantalizing prospect for decades, but the Pentagon has been less than enthusiastic.</description>

      <title>Here's What the Army Thinks War Will Look Like in 2030</title>
      <author>Stephanie Gaskell</author>
      <description>Even with new innovations and evolving threats, the Army's vision of what war might look like and the challenges they would face in the year 2030 isn't all that different than today. Army leaders recently conducted a "deep future" war game to play out a military conflict 15 years from now, coined "Unified Quest," and held at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle Barracks, Pa.  Defense One was invited to listen in as dozens of Army brass and civilian and foreign counterparts conducted an after-action review at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.</description>

      <title>Compromise Reached on 2014 Defense Bill</title>
      <author>Rick Maze</author>
      <description>Congressional negotiators unveiled a compromise $632.8 billion defense policy bill on Monday that they hope can pass the House and Senate by Christmas to avoid disruption in military programs. It includes an extension of expiring special pays and bonuses that will otherwise expire on Jan. 1, a prohibition against creating any new Tricare user fees and raising any existing fees by more than 1.7 percent next October, and includes hundreds of other provisions affecting service members, retirees and their families. The result of negotiations involving the so-called "Big Four" on defense, the chairmen and ranking minority party members of the House and Senate armed services committees, the bill represents the only chance for a National Defense Authorization Act for 2014 to pass Congress before Jan. 1, the leaders said.</description>

      <title>The Army's 8-Wheeled Laser Truck Can Burn Mortars, Drones Right Out of the Sky</title>
      <author>Amanda Macias</author>
      <description>For the first time, the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command used a vehicle mounted high-energy laser to successfully engage more than 90 enemy mortar rounds and flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD) contracted by Boeing, was tested at White Sands Missile Range and confirms the capability of a mobile laser weapon system to counter rockets, artillery, mortars, UAVs, and reconnaissance sensors mounted on UAVs. The beam control system (BCS) is a dome-shaped turret that extends above the roof of a 500-horsepower Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT). The beam director rotates 360-degrees and uses mirrors to point and focus the quarter-sized beam on a target.</description>

      <description>Congress in 2009 passed the mother of all defense acquisition reform bills. The Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act was praised by the Obama administration and congressional leaders as a much-needed antidote to complacent Pentagon bureaucracies that had become unaccountable for massive cost overruns and delays in major programs. But there are still plenty of inadequacies in defense acquisitions, lawmakers have found. These vexing issues might not warrant another major piece of legislation but are serious enough to justify a fresh probe by the House Armed Services Committee.</description>

      <title>Army Ponders Its Post-War Identity</title>
      <author>Sandra I. Erwin</author>
      <description>Army leaders are entering familiar territory as they contemplate how to reshape their forces for leaner times. The current Army is too large, too expensive and mostly geared to fight counterinsurgencies, and it is now seeking to forge a new identity as a multifaceted force that can adapt to a broader range of threats. Today's existential crisis of sorts is not unlike the one the Army experienced in the late 1990s, when it was struggling to adjust to the post-Soviet world. The transition was interrupted by the 9/11 attacks, a gush of money and a massive reorganization that was needed to fight two wars.</description>

      <title>Budget Pressures Force Army to Scale Back Investment in Network</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>Why is the myth of easy war so appealing to American strategists? Over the last decade, the United States spent more than a trillion dollars and the lives of thousands of American troops unlearning the tenets of network-centric warfare, the 1990s-vintage belief that precision strikes by coordinated, high-tech forces would allow the country to obliterate critical nodes in enemy defenses. Hostile forces would collapse under such punishment, and opponents would rapidly bow to American desires, making the capability to execute protracted ground wars unnecessary -- or so the theory went.</description>

      <title>US Army Releases RFP for New Armored Vehicle</title>
      <author>PAUL McLEARY</author>
      <description>After releasing several draft request for proposal (RFP) documents over the past year, on Tuesday the US Army finally released the final specs for the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle's (AMPV's) engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase. Despite sequestration and the service's need to cut billions of dollars from its budget in the coming years, the program appears to be soldiering on, with a solid requirement of 2,907 vehicles to be built over 13 years at roughly $1.8 million apiece. In October, the service announced it intended to delay the start of the program by a year while raising developmental costs by several hundred million dollars in its quest to replace thousands of Vietnam War-era M113 tracked armored personnel carriers.</description>

      <author>Stew Smith</author>
      <description>To lose weight, there are a few factors that you must consider for any weight loss program to be effective. If you remember the following formulas, you should be able to lose weight in a healthy manner and better yet, KEEP IT OFF! This formula is as basic as weight loss gets. If you exercise more calories than you eat at the end of the day, you will lose weight. Creating a calorie deficiency at the end of a day does not mean you have to starve yourself.</description>

      <description>Almost every time this country finishes a major war, we cut the Army appropriately — and then we cut too much. After World War II, we demobilized massively, but then went too far. The result in 1950 was Task Force Smith, the first U.S. Army ground unit to enter combat in Korea, and a debacle on the peninsula as the Army was unprepared for what ensued in the early months of that conflict. After Vietnam, we not only downsized but allowed readiness and standards of excellence to keep declining.</description>

      <title>Army Official Predicts 'Mass Migration' Away From BlackBerry Smartphones</title>
      <author>Stew Magnuson</author>
      <description>SAN DIEGO — Android and iOS enabled devices will largely replace the ubiquitous BlackBerry as the Army's smartphone of choice in the coming years, a senior service official said Nov. 19 at the Milcom conference here. Lt. Col. Ed Mattison, Army CIO/G-6 cyber security directorate and mobility technical lead, said there won't be any top down orders to make the switch from one type of smartphone to another because it is up to each individual command to dictate and fund their own mobility requirements. They all receive their mobility services from the Defense Information Systems Agency depending on their individual needs.</description>

      <title>Army Shows Off Possible Power-Saving Soldier Technologies</title>
      <author>Valerie Insinna</author>
      <description>As the Army looks for ways to boost power sources without adding on bulky or heavy gadgetry, it's also trying to improve how a soldier manages his power supply. A two-pound conformal battery is the centerpiece of the Nett Warrior system, which is intended to improve troops' situational awareness and is currently being fielded by the service. A soldier can wear the battery in the side or front pocket of his vest, and the device is flexible enough to bend with the user's movements, said Jonathan Novoa, a mechanical engineer with the fuel cell development team at the Army's Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC). "This system allows the user to use a central battery to power all the peripherals that are on their person," he said. "So instead of the soldier worrying about replacing various batteries of various types and all their devices, now they only have to worry about logistics supporting one battery."</description>

      <title>Army pursuing family of Osprey-like aircraft</title>
      <author>Seth Robson</author>
      <description>Tilt-rotor aircraft that look like mini-Ospreys are vying with other new designs to replace thousands of U.S. military helicopters. Tilt rotors are incorporated in two of four vertical-lift designs awarded funding by the Department of Defense last month. The Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator funding is part of efforts to build a family of vertical-lift vehicles that could replace thousands of aircraft over the next 50 years, according to the Army.</description>

      <title>Real Acquisition Reform, Like Christianity, Needs To Be Tried</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>George Bernard Shaw once observed that "Christianity might be a good thing if anyone ever tried it." The same can be said for defense acquisition reform. For decades government officials, members of Congress, defense experts and those concerned about wasteful government spending from across the political spectrum have bewailed the Pentagon's broken acquisition system. But when it comes to practicing what is preached, the political system always seems to come up short. There have been more than 100 studies, reports and commissions over the past four decades on the subject with very little to show in the way of results. Even the most successful efforts, such as the 1985 Packard Commission, had only limited impact over time.</description>

      <author>Craig Whitlock</author>
      <description>From his office deep inside the Pentagon, Yoda has outlasted the Cold War, countless military conflicts and 10 presidential elections. But can he survive the sequester? Yoda is the reverential nickname for Andrew W. Marshall, a legendary if mysterious figure in national security circles. A bald, enigmatic 92-year-old strategic guru, he resembles the Jedi master of "Star Wars" fame in more ways than one.</description>

      <title>US Army Network Proves Mettle In Afghanistan</title>

      <description>WASHINGTON — Despite some changes, one of the most celebrated innovations in soldier communication and situational awareness to hit the battlefield over the past 12 years of war is working just fine in Afghanistan, US Army leaders insist. But leaders are concerned about the availability of funding to upgrade the network next year.</description>

      <description>At the conclusion of their summer internship at the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), three William and Mary students participated in the Unified Quest: Deep Futures Wargame at the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pa.  Lt. Gen. Keith Walker recognized the students — Amanda Brazzel '13, Christopher Coelho '15, and Eric Sawchak '14 — for their outstanding work over the summer preparing for the simulation.  The students conducted research and wrote papers for the Human Dimension, Future Warfare, and Science and Technology Divisions of TRADOC's Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC).</description>

      <title>Military looks to reuse IT equipment</title>
      <author>Defense Systems Staff</author>
      <description>The Defense Department is achieving substantial savings by reusing old hardware, particularly IT equipment, Amber Corrin of sister publication FCW reports. The Army's Brigade Modernization Command, for example, estimates it is saving about $7 million annually by repurposing automation equipment, FCW found. The command said high-end hardware used for computing-intensive simulation applications can be reused at the end of its life cycle as desktop computers.</description>

      <title>Debt Ceiling Fight Will Imperil Defense Spending</title>
      <author>John T. Bennett</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON — In the week following the US government shutdown, tea party Republicans are now poised for a new attack on federal spending as lawmakers and the White House battle over the nation's borrowing limit. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has put Congress on notice: The United States will hit its borrowing ceiling on Oct. 17. Far-right House Republicans have been salivating for a debt-ceiling fight for months, eager to take on what the chamber's top Republican calls "Washington's spending problem."</description>

      <title>New Radios, Waveforms Move Military Communications Into the Sky</title>
      <author>Henry S. Kenyon</author>
      <description>The U.S. Defense Department has spent the last decade developing a family of multiband programmable radios and waveforms designed to move voice, data and video with the goal of connecting small tactical units with larger battlefield networks. Much of this work has focused on supporting warfighters on the ground through vehicle and man-portable radios. But the services now are looking at other ways to connect troops by installing the new radios in aircraft.</description>

      <title>U.S. Military Must Integrate Forward Presence, Crisis Response And Expeditionary Warfare Missions</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>The U.S. military is the only one in the world that can actually conduct operations across the political-military spectrum from building partnership capacity to global conflict. It is also uniquely positioned to employ an array of instruments, including so-called soft power tools, to influence positively the security situation in nations and regions of interest. The three keys to this unique U.S. military role in the future will be its ability to do forward presence, crisis response and expeditionary operations. </description>

      <title>Soldiers take questions to the Army boss on Facebook</title>
      <author>Antonieta Rico</author>
      <description>Soldiers asked the Army's top boss about the threat to their pay in the face of sequestration and a possible government shutdown during Gen. Ray Odierno's first virtual town hall meeting on Facebook on Tuesday. The Army chief of staff took questions from soldiers on Facebook for about an hour, the first time he has opened such a forum.</description>

      <title>Army Gets Green Light to Acquire New Vehicle Radios</title>
      <author>Sandra I. Erwin</author>
      <description>Pentagon weapons acquisition chief Frank Kendall has cleared the way for the Army to purchase 232 high-bandwidth radios that would provide combat brigades with mobile, high-speed communications. "I authorize the Army to proceed with its contracting activities to meet MNVR requirements," Kendall wrote in a Sept. 20 "acquisition decision memorandum" to the secretary of the Army.</description>

      <title>Strategic Horizons: Land Power Myths, Identity Crisis Put U.S. Army on the Back Foot</title>
      <author>Steven Metz</author>
      <description>As the U.S. military struggles with severe budget cuts driven by political posturing rather than a strategic vision, the Army is facing a deep identity crisis. As defense expert Nadia Schadlow explained, "After 10 years of fighting two major wars and suffering the brunt of America's military casualties, the most experienced and powerful ground force in the world now has to justify its value and relevance."</description>

      <title>Strategic Speed</title>
      <author>Daniel Sukman</author>
      <description>Speed has become the catchword for concept developers over the past couple of years.  Speed has focused on how fast a unit can move from one physical location to another.  This paradigm for speed needs to be re-thought.  How quickly a force can achieve national endstates is the speed that is vital to our nation's elements of national power.  This speed may mean slower operational and tactical speed in terms of unit movement and deployment timelines.  What is vital is how quickly a force can serve the needs of the nation.</description>

      <title>First regionally aligned BCT shares lessons learned</title>
      <author>Michelle Tan</author>
      <description>Working with foreign partners presents soldiers with a new set of challenges, according to the commander of the first unit to be regionally aligned with a combatant command. Soldiers from 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, have been aligned with Africa Command since last spring, conducting more than 40 missions in such countries as South Africa, Niger, Chad, Djibouti, Malawi, Uganda, Burundi and Sierra Leone.</description>

      <title>Army scientists find ways to make body armor lighter</title>
      <author>Joe Gould</author>
      <description>Army scientists say they have pioneered a way to make body armor for soldiers that would be 10 percent lighter, but just as strong. "This is parasitic weight, this is weight that's on them constantly and sapping their energy in extreme environments, but in the instant it's needed, it needs to work," said Shawn Walsh, who leads the project at the Army Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. ARL falls under Army Research, Development and Engineering Command.</description>

      <title>US Army Blesses AUSA Conference, Other Events to Hit the Road</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>It wasn't until just days before the last year's annual Association of the United States Army (AUSA) convention in Washington that Army Secretary John McHugh signed off on a memo authorizing uniformed personnel to attend. Budget cuts, the looming uncertainty over sequestration, and recent conference scandals that exposed millions spent by the General Services Administration and the Department of Veterans' Affairs on pricey boondoggles led to an air of caution, both over the real costs as well as the images those meetings projected.</description>

      <author>Michael L. Haxton</author>
      <description>This is the first in a series of three articles that discuss analytics of the human dimension of conflict. Much is being written on the human dimension of conflict, but much of it is using differing versions of what is important. This first article focuses on defining the concepts for analyzing the human dimension of conflict.</description>

      <title>Changing the Strategic Dialogue: New Definitions for Landpower and Land Control</title>
      <author>Jeremy Sauer and Michael Kaiser</author>
      <description>As U.S. Armed Forces exit from more than a decade of war, the services must respond to new strategic guidance, changes in the operational environment, and emerging technologies and refine, or even redefine, their contributions to the Nation.  Like the other services, the U.S. Army maintains a wide array of responsibilities which go well beyond winning the nation's wars. While the maritime and air components account for their range of contributions through their description of sea and air power and control, the Army has yet to communicate its full utility due to limited definitions of landpower and land control.</description>

      <title>Army Prepares to Start Radio Competition</title>
      <author>Brendan McGarry</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army is moving forward with plans to hold a competition to buy smartphone-compatible radios for troops.  The service this week outlined its plans in a draft notice, known in acquisition parlance as a request for proposals, or RfP. It plans to begin the competition this fall and award a single company with a production contract in 2014.  Potential bidders will include General Dynamics Corp., which is currently developing the so-called Rifleman Radio, and Harris Corp., among other companies.</description>

      <title>Why The Army Matters: Human Factors And Killing</title>
      <author>Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.</author>
      <description>The US Army is wrestling with how to stay relevant once large-scale counterinsurgency in Afghanistan comes to an end. The Marines are going back to their roots — amphibious warfare — and they've got a piece of the hot concept called AirSea Battle. The Navy has little to worry about with the Pacific pivot highlighting the importance of the service's global reach — and they're central to AirSea Battle. The Air Force is still trying to figure out its real future but AirSea Battle gives the USAF a major role.</description>

      <title>Thinking Outside The Box May Mean Ending Up In A Slightly Bigger Box</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>Everyone seems convinced that sequestration and the end of the wars in Southwest Asia presents the Pentagon with a unique opportunity to "think outside the box."</description>

      <description>The Obama administration initially agreed. Its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review stated that after successfully concluding current wars, "in the mid- to long term, U.S. military forces must plan and prepare to prevail in a broad range of operations that may occur in multiple theaters in overlapping time frames.</description>

      <author>MG H. R. McMaster</author>
      <description>"A GREAT deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep," the novelist Saul Bellow once wrote. We should keep that in mind when we consider the lessons from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — lessons of supreme importance as we plan the military of the future.</description>

      <title>Hagel: DoD Must 'Fundamentally Reshape' Itself</title>
      <author>Marcus Weisgerber</author>
      <description>The Pentagon must "fundamentally reshape" itself to adapt for a future of strategic and budgetary challenges, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Monday. Speaking at the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Louisville, Ky., Hagel laid out four principles "that will guide these efforts to realign and reshape our military": prioritizing DoD's missions and capabilities around the core responsibility of defending the US; maximizing the military's combat power; and preserving and strengthening military readiness and honoring the service and sacrifice.</description>

      <author>Erik Schechter</author>
      <description>Are tube-fired "suicide" drones the new pocket artillery that will give dismounted troops a smaller footprint and a longer reach? Developers of lethal miniature aerial munition systems certainly think so as they gear up for a new Army program set for fiscal 2016.</description>

      <title>As Spending Comes Down, Strategic Choices Needed</title>
      <author>Lou Kratz</author>
      <description>After more than a decade of conflict, the United States has begun to draw down defense spending, with sequestration cuts expected to continue over the coming years. The Defense Department must cope with declining resources at a time when it also faces persistent global threats and is under pressure to modernize aging systems to deter emerging competitors.</description>

      <author>Kevin Baron</author>
      <description>As he nears the end of his first two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- and his nearly 40-year career in uniform -- sources close to Gen. Martin Dempsey insist that he enters Thursday's Senate confirmation hearing feeling freer to lean forward and speak up with a new warning: the U.S. must balance its global ambition with reality.</description>

      <author>Dr. Oscar Ware</author>
      <description>The domains influencing international politics has significantly changed since the end of World War II. In this new landscape military leaders and politicians alike continue to debate future threats, nature of conflicts and the national strategy. Nation states that were once consumers of security have become producers, and find themselves projecting their political and military influence well beyond their boarders.</description>

      <title>What Next for Army Force Structure</title>
      <author>Nathan Freier and Jacquelyn Guy</author>
      <description>Two weeks ago, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno announced significant Army force structure reductions. The impending reorganization helps meet an Army obligation and an Army desire. First, the obligation—it allows the Army to satisfy the fiscal demands required by 2011's Budget Control Act (BCA). Second, the desire—as the Army eliminates brigade headquarters from its structure to meet budget requirements, it can at the same time increase the fighting potential of its brigade combat teams (BCTs). Specifically, the elimination of BCT headquarters frees up an additional maneuver battalion for each of the Army's infantry and armored BCTs.</description>

      <title>New leader for brigade command at Fort Bliss</title>
      <author>David Purge</author>
      <description>Brig. Gen. John W. Charlton would be the first to admit he's not a real high-tech kind of guy. Charlton is an infantryman by trade who has some serious combat experience. He is also the new commander of the Brigade Modernization Command, a Fort Bliss organization that helps to spearhead Army modernization. "When I was first coming here, I was curious," Charlton said. "We do a lot of very technical stuff and use a lot of technical equipment, a lot of technology."</description>

      <description>SOME attacks come out of nowhere. Others arrive with plenty of warning. The 2011 Budget Control Act (BCA), also known as the sequester, was one of the latter. But for a long time the Pentagon ignored it, assuming that the cuts to defence spending it contained would never happen.</description>

      <title>Glimpse Inside Air-Sea Battle: Nukes, Cyber At Its Heart</title>
      <author>Sydney Freedberg</author>
      <description>PENTAGON: In intellectual terms, Air-Sea Battle is the biggest of the military's big ideas for its post-Afghanistan future. But what is it, really? It's a constantly evolving concept for high-tech, high-intensity conflict that touches on everything from cyberwar to nuclear escalation to the rise of China. In practical terms, however, the beating heart of AirSea Battle is eleven overworked officers working in windowless Pentagon meeting rooms, and the issues they can't get to are at least as important as the ones they can.</description>

      <title>At One Army Base, a Vision for a New Shade of Green</title>
      <author>Neela Banerjee</author>
      <description>The endless desert that makes up Ft. Bliss looks a lot like places where the United States fought its recent wars or where it might fight its next one. Tanks are manned by soldiers whose faces are wrapped against the blowing sand. Dust devils rise, stagger and fall to the desert floor.</description>

      <title>Quick-Reaction Force Stands Up in East Africa</title>
      <author>Michelle Tan</author>
      <description>PENTAGON: The Army has stood up a quick-reaction force to respond to contingencies such as the September attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. The East Africa Response Force, made up mostly of soldiers from 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, is based at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti.</description>

      <title>The Pentagon's Fair-Share Budget Strategy: Reps. Forbes and Larsen</title>
      <author>Rep. J. Randy Forbes and Rep. Rick Larsen</author>
      <description>It would come as no surprise to anyone for us to say that Washington has a problem generating and implementing long-range strategy. The real challenge rests with addressing the origins of this dilemma. We think one hindrance to good strategy is clear – the Pentagon's long-standing practice of building budgets that, regardless of our strategy, give relatively equal shares to each of the services. This trend has remained constant over the past several decades despite continuous cycles of change as the Cold War peaked and then came to an end, as new strategy documents were introduced, as budgets grew and shrank, and as new technologies altered the way wars are fought.</description>

      <title>Army Cuts 10 Combat Brigades -- Or 11, Or 13 -- And That's Just The Beginning</title>
      <author>Sydney Freedberg</author>
      <description>The Army's widely publicized decision to cut 10 brigade combat teams from bases in eight states is just part of the story of the incredible shrinking armed services. To start with, it's not actually 10 brigades: It's 11, the 10 announced this afternoon and a player to be named later. Or, if you count two brigades being eliminated at bases in Europe, an announcement made months ago, it's 13.</description>

      <title>The U.S. Army's Phone Just Keeps Ringing</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army's phone rings constantly too. The big difference between my response and that of the Army's Chief of Staff, General Raymond Odierno, is that he can't ignore the calls, hang up on the caller (usually the National Command authority, the Joint Chiefs or a Combatant Commander), or claim that the check is in the mail. He has to answer all his calls and most often respond to whatever request is being made. Moreover, even though these calls usually are orders directing the Army to prepare for something, spend money on something or send forces somewhere, he almost never can say no.</description>

      <title>The National Guard Must Again Become A Strategic Reserve</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>One such change or reversal must be in the role of the National Guard. Historically, the Guard has been a strategic reserve for the U.S. Army to be mobilized in federal service under Title 10 of the U.S. Code in the event of a larger-than-expected contingency. The other way the Guard can be mobilized is under Title 32 of the same code for a domestic emergency. In such an event the Guard is placed under the command of the state's governor through its adjutant general.</description>

      <description>Dressed in purple TV shirts and black jeans (with the bling pins announcing the branch in which their husband serves), dozens of ladies assembled on the stage. None of them were mean to each other. None of them publicly spent money they didn't have or whined or smacked their kids or tried on bras for the camera.</description>

      <title>National Guard Seeks to Expand Active Role In Military</title>
      <author>Steff Thomas</author>
      <description>The National Guard, best known for its commitment to stateside operations, could continue to expand the active role it has played for the past decade as officials argue that guard troops are a cost-effective alternative to full-time soldiers. While the National Guard does not wish to abandon its domestic disaster relief efforts, cleaning up after hurricanes is not all it does anymore, said Lt. Gen. Joseph  Lengyel, vice chief of the National Guard Bureau.</description>

      <description>The Army is moving closer to fielding a next-generation infrared sensor that will allow soldiers to detect an enemy's heat signature at greater distances. Raytheon officials said its third wave of forward-looking infrared devices, called FLIR, could be in soldiers' hands within a few years.</description>

      <title>Battlefield Sensors Continue To Make Technological Leaps</title>
      <author>Stew Magnuson</author>
      <description>Over the past dozen years, the U.S. military has rapidly fielded next-generation battlefield sensors to find roadside bombs and the insurgents who plant them. Hyperspectral and wide-area surveillance sensors are two examples of technologies that military leaders have touted as success stories.</description>

      <title>A Hollow Military Again?</title>
      <author>James Kitfield</author>
      <description>Even in the best of times, U.S. leaders have stumbled trying to manage the tricky transition between war and what comes after. Following every "war to end all wars," the American people demand a "peace dividend" that often cuts defense spending too deep for too long, eroding military preparedness.</description>

      <description>Sequestration has created considerable challenges for the Army. In addition to the short-term uncertainties surrounding budget cuts, the service also faces long-term difficulties adapting to a changing world. Leaders are seeking answers to questions that will affect strategic, doctrinal and training decisions: What will future warfare look like? Where will it occur? How it will be fought? How should we prepare?</description>

      <title>Gen Petraeus: We must be coldly realistic over the use of force</title>
      <author>GEN David Petraeus (R)</author>
      <description>Since leaving the US government, I have had an opportunity to think about some of the missions in which I was privileged to engage while in uniform and then as director of the CIA. Reflecting on what some term the "counter-insurgency era" – or occasionally even "the Petraeus era" – I want to argue that this era is far from over, for the simple reason that the era of insurgency is not over.</description>

      <description>The fundamental nature of war is a clash of wills between organized socio-political entities.  This understanding about war emphasizes its iterative and competitive nature, but American strategic culture often overlooks Clausewitz's insight that strategy is not an exercise with inanimate matter, but with living opponents with interests, passions, decision options, and above all else, a will and goal of their own.</description>

      <title>US Army Maps Future of the Electronic Battlefield</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>With uncontested control of the skies and with little to fear from electronic jamming or precision fires, virtually all of the defensive electronic warfare missions they have conducted involve roadside bombs. But future battlefields will likely be more complex and not quite as permissive, analysts and Pentagon thinkers warn, citing the increasing proliferation of precision munitions and the more sophisticated communications and electronic jamming gear that states can now wield.</description>

      <title>Asking The Right Questions About Active/Reserve Mix</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>As U.S. defense budgets decline, possibly by as much as $1 trillion over the next decade, the Pentagon, Congress and defense experts are all on the hunt for ways of reducing the cost of defense without having to gut force structure and modernization. One commonly raised question is whether the Pentagon can save money by reducing the readiness of some, perhaps much of the force and to shift the balance between the Active Component and Reserve Component more towards the latter. A number of studies suggest that personnel in the Reserve Component cost only a third as much as those in the Active Component.</description>

      <title>Army to Increase Overseas Presence Despite Budget Cuts</title>
      <author>Sandra Erwin</author>
      <description>The Army has canceled major combat training exercises this year as a result of automatic budget cuts that went into effect March 1. The lack of training funds, however, will not hamstring the Army's ambitious plan to expand its presence in key regions of the world, officials said.</description>

      <title>Army Chief Outlines Worries About Allies, Terrorism, Budgets</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>While the size and relative buying power of the US may be declining, American allies will depend on the US Army even more in the future than they do now, Army chief Gen. Ray Odierno said Wednesday. While the question-and-answer session at the Atlantic Council in Washington contained the requisite talk of sequestration and how the mandated cuts will affect the force, Odierno spent the bulk of his time fielding questions about threats that the United States, and the Army, will likely face in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Odierno: Don't Rule Out Ground Wars When Cutting Army Forces</title>
      <author>Chris Carroll</author>
      <description>Defense budget chaos and bad assumptions about the future of American warfare could result in an Army that's too small to do its job, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno said Wednesday. The Army is reducing toward an active-duty end strength of 490,000 troops by 2017, Odierno told an audience at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.</description>

      <title>US Land Forces Highlight Their Importance Through 'Human Domain' Interaction</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>"Thinking is free," the leadership of the US Army, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command write in a new Strategic Landpower Task Force white paper released this week. The three land services have been talking about the task force for months, but the paper, dramatically titled, "Strategic Landpower: Winning The Clash of Wills," is the first concrete product it has produced in an effort to remind a fickle Congress that land power still matters, even as naval and air assets are receiving most of the attention in the "rebalance" to Asia.</description>

      <title>Lawmakers Press Pentagon to Fund Battlefield Network</title>
      <author>Brendan McGarry</author>
      <description>A group of 71 members of the U.S. House of Representatives is pressing the Defense Department to avoid transferring funding from a battlefield communications network to pay for more urgent needs. The lawmakers, most of whom are Democrats, said they support two General Dynamics Corp. programs — the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, or WIN-T, and the Joint Tactical Radio System's Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit, or HMS — to provide troops in the war zone with voice and data communications, according to a May 10 letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and obtained by Military.com.</description>

      <title>Budget Cuts Are Killing Military Preparedness</title>
      <author>Loren Thompson</author>
      <description>The political war in Washington over funding of the federal government has begun to undermine the nation's military preparedness.  Senior military leaders are warning Congress that if the government's broken budgeting process cannot be made more predictable, it will have a "cascading" effect on the joint force in future years that leaves the force unprepared to respond to new threats.</description>

      <author>Michael Hoffman</author>
      <description>The leaders of the Army, Marine Corps and Special Operations Forces have offered their response to the Air Force and Navy's Air-Sea Battle with an exclusive task force of their own: Strategic Landpower. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Amos and Adm. William McRaven, head of U.S. Special Operations forces, each signed a white paper released May 13 that outlines their plans to ensure the nation's investment in its land warfare forces doesn't waver in the face of budget cuts and a national defense strategy that emphasizes the Pacific.</description>

      <title>McHugh Looks to Ramp Up Pacific Partnerships</title>
      <author>Joe Gould</author>
      <description>As the Army looks beyond current conflicts to the future role of land forces, it is a "full partner" in efforts underway to develop operating concepts in the region, the Army secretary said April 30. "We're talking about how do the ground forces … posture themselves as a viable part of the national military strategy going forward," Secretary John McHugh told reporters in Washington, D.C. "We envision it as a complement, not a competition."</description>

      <title>Gen. Odierno: Budget Crunch Will Render Army Unready For Syria &amp; Hybrid War</title>
      <author>Sydney Freedberg</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON: While the Army can keep troops headed for Afghanistan trained up and ready to go, the ongoing budget gridlock threatens its ability to prepare for crises around the world – from North Korea to Syria – conflicts that would require a very different kind of training than the counterinsurgency tactics the force has focused on for years. That's the warning from Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno, who added that the service might even have to submit an "unfunded requirements" wish list to Congress for the first time in years.</description>

      <title>Odierno: Strengthen Ties Between Special Operators, Big Army</title>
      <author>Stew Magnuson</author>
      <description>Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Ray Odierno said the Army, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command are moving forward to integrate the lessons they have learned over the past 10 years battling for the hearts and minds of local populations. He is a believer that a "seventh warfighting function" should be added to the Army's skill set. It acknowledges that the human and cultural domain is an important part of any battle zone. Understanding the nature of local populations is something that Army Special Operations Forces knows well.</description>

      <title>NIE Evaluation 13.2: 'Iron Brigade' Setting Milestones for Army's Future</title>
      <author>Sgt. Vincent Byrd, 2nd BCT, 1st AD Public Affairs</author>
      <description>NIE is a semi-annual, Soldier-led evaluation with the purpose of validating and evaluating equipment and systems, while emphasizing mission readiness and training. During the evaluations, the Army integrates network capability and then uses a full BCT to assess network and non-network abilities to determine their impact across the many venues that are significant to the Army's plan. The event is an enduring Army process and enables formation effectiveness and increased operational capability to provide proven integrated capabilities into the hands of Soldiers.</description>

      <description>The U.S. Army's top civilian pushed back against critics who say the service's next-generation combat vehicle is the wrong choice to replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. The so-called Ground Combat Vehicle "is a highly viable program," Army Secretary John McHugh said during an April 30 breakfast with reporters. It's "one of our critical modernization efforts going forward," he said.</description>

      <title>The Peril of Sequestration</title>
      <author>Frederick Kagan</author>
      <description>Sequestration has done material harm to America's national security at a dangerous moment. The predictable crisis resulting from Iran's pursuit of nuclear-weapons capability is evolving in a way that requires a serious and credible American military threat in support of negotiations and other non-military efforts to resolve it.</description>

      <description>RANGE 24, FORT DRUM, NEW YORK: "That's awesome," said Maj. Edward Sedlock, watching another soldier call up data on his militarized Android smartphone. It was such small, unguarded moments -- neither officer had noticed a reporter standing nearby -- which suggest that, after more than a decade in development, the Army's struggle to bring wireless networking to the foot soldier is finally yielding fruit, just in time to help secure the drawdown in Afghanistan.</description>

      <title>Army To Congress: If You Can't Stop Sequester, At Least Slow It Down</title>
      <author>Sydney Freedberg</author>
      <description>"Speed kills." It looks as if the Pentagon may well adopt that old highway-safety slogan as its new strategy to combat the so-called sequester, which will cut $500 billion from the defense budget over the next decade unless the White House and Congress can reach the ever-elusive "grand bargain" to reduce the deficit by other means.</description>

      <title>Pentagon Seeks More Cybersecurity Funding</title>
      <author>Brendan McGarry</author>
      <description>The Pentagon wants more funding to protect its computer networks from attack as Congress considers legislation to allow intelligence agencies to share information about potential threats with the private sector. The Defense Department's spending on so-called cyberspace operations would jump 21 percent to $4.7 billion in fiscal 2014, which begins Oct. 1. The figures are part of President Barack Obama's budget request, released on April 10, two months after the statutory deadline.</description>

The material had not only stopped the bullets but also remained clear; there were no cracks and the material had even sealed the bullets' entry-holes behind them.</description>

      <title>The Last Army Standing</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure</author>
      <description>What is the value to the United States of the Army? This is a question which the Chief of Staff, General Odierno, and senior uniformed and civilian leaders of this venerable organization are having trouble answering. They have experimented with a number of different arguments. For example, they assert that people and governments live and work on land and it is on land that you will have the greatest possibility to influence their behavior in peace or war.</description>

      <title>New Defense Budget Means More Financial Uncertainty for Pentagon</title>
      <author>David Alexander</author>
      <description>The Obama administration is poised to roll out a 2014 defense budget that is billions of dollars higher than legally mandated spending caps, setting the stage for another year of financial uncertainty and turmoil at the Pentagon, defense analysts say.</description>

      <title>BRAC Is Back and Sequester's Here To Stay: Understanding Hagel and HASC</title>
      <author>Sydney Freedberg</author>
      <description>WASHINGTON: Congress seems increasingly resigned to sequestration cuts and base closures, ideas which once met fierce rejection on Capitol Hill. That's the counterintuitive takeaway from Chuck Hagel's first hearing as Defense Secretary on the 2014 budget request, one largely overtaken by events.</description>

      <title>Strategic Horizons: The U.S. Military Can't Ignore the Deep Future</title>
      <author>Steven Metz</author>
      <description>During the 1990s, the U.S. Department of Defense concluded that it was in a "strategic pause." With the Soviet Union gone and no equal threat on the horizon, the Pentagon had the luxury of doing things like building a "futures" industry to think big thoughts about long-range changes underway in the security environment and the nature of armed conflict. But today strategic futurists face hard times.</description>

      <description>A debate is raging these days over the future of American national security strategy, and the size and shape of the military force needed to implement it. Nearly everyone agrees that the United States needs a less expensive approach and a smaller military. But what should be cut—and by how much</description>

      <author>David Burge</author>
      <description>A bipartisan group of senators and congressmen is already working to protect Fort Bliss just as the Army begins plans to reduce its force during the next seven years. The Army plans to reduce its active-duty soldiers from 562,000 to 490,000 by 2020. Natural attrition would take care of some of that reduction, Army officials said.</description>

      <author>Barry Rosenberg</author>
      <description>The acquisition strategy that the Army has used for its mobile, tactical network known as Capability Set 13 will now be applied to the acquisition of the entire network from DISA headquarters at Ft. Meade, MD, to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. "A cutting edge end-to-end network is essential to every Army mission," said Army Secretary John McHugh in memorandum signed March 11. "A robust, versatile, lethal force cannot exist in the 21st Century environment, under tightening fiscal conditions, without a capability set management approach."</description>

After a few high-profile program cancellations and schedule slippages in recent years, the next-generation vehicles the service says its needs are still a work in progress, and at this point, in flux. And yet one thing is certain: Tight budgets mean new vehicles must be more survivable and must be modifiable as new technologies come onboard.</description>

      <title>Desperate DoD Needs A "Manhattan Project" To Fix Its Broken Acquisition System</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>I don't believe that reducing defense spending will necessarily make the Department of Defense (DoD) more innovative, as some have claimed. DoD's problem is not strategic or operational and the answer cannot be found in clever organizational designs or new technologies. The Pentagon's challenge is how to reconcile in its force planning and investment strategies a profound disconnect between the American people's apparent unwillingness to spend money on a large, sophisticated military and the appetite of the nation's leaders to employ the military.</description>

      <title>Gen McMaster: Raiders, Advisors, and the Wrong Lessons From Iraq</title>
      <author>Sydney Freedberg</author>
      <description>Washington: On the tenth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq one of the Army's leading thinkers, warned Washington not to learn the wrong lessons. Army Maj. Gen. H.R. McMaster, now chief of the tank and infantry school at Fort Benning singled out two pitfalls in particular, one about over-reliance on Special Operations raiders, the other about over-reliance on proxies and advisors. Call them (our words, not his) the Zero Dark Thirty fallacy and the Lawrence of Arabia fallacy.</description>

      <title>Revised 'Pivot to Asia' Strategy Not Likely to Reduce Military Involvement Around the Globe</title>
      <author>Dan Parsons</author>
      <description>The year-old defense strategic guidance authored by the Obama administration is being rewritten in the wake of sequestration budget cuts that could wipe out $500 billion in military spending over the next decade. Senior military leaders, nonetheless, do not expect the revised strategy will reduce the armed forces' global presence.</description>

      <title>Three Critical Lessons From The Iraq War To Remember</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>The tenth anniversary of the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) has produced an expected flood of articles and blogs discussing the events and decisions that led up to the invasion of Iraq as well as lessons learned from this war. Not surprisingly, most of them have focused on questions of politics, strategy and intelligence. There are also important operational lessons from OIF that need to be recognized and absorbed. These are particularly important as the Pentagon struggles to deal with a trillion dollars in budget cuts and the need to reshape the U.S. military.</description>

      <title>Future Vertical Lift Takes Step Forward</title>
      <author>Valerie Insinna</author>
      <description>Army officials have been talking for almost a decade about new vertical takeoff and landing aircraft to replace its aging fleets of helicopters. The recent kickoff of a technical demonstrator program marks a transition from dialogue to actually putting an aircraft in the sky. Prototypes for the new platform — interchangeably called joint multi-role or future vertical lift — could be flown as early as fiscal year 2017. A broad area announcement for the joint multi-role technical demonstrator was put out in August 2012.</description>

      <title>Armor: Key to the Future Fight</title>
      <author>Col. David B. Haight, Col. Paul J. Laughlin and Capt. Kyle F. Bergner</author>
      <description>Some argue that new technologies will enable the naval and air forces, in combination with special forces, to fight and win in future armed conflict without the commitment of significant Army or Marine forces. Others cite a decrease in conventional land armies and an increase in anti-access/area-denial technology and operations as reason to shrink the Army's ready combined arms forces through various means such as transfers to reserve components or reduced commitments in regions such as South Korea.</description>

      <title>Researchers Tackle Troops' Physical, Cognitive Challenges</title>
      <author>Yasmin Tadjdeh</author>
      <description>In order for troops to fight to the best of their ability, experts say the military must lighten their backpacks, reduce "information overload" and improve their physical fitness. "Load and bulk impacts our soldier's mobility, their survivability and effectiveness in their ability to make contact with the enemy and maintain contact with the enemy," said Pat Berger, deputy capability manager for the soldier at U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).</description>

      <description>As the end of the draft in 1972 ushered in the era of the professional force we know today, the military instituted another key reform that transformed America's ability to wage war, at least on a large scale. Still smarting from the failure of the nation's body politic to do what had been done in every major war prior to Vietnam -- namely, to call up the militia -- a group of Army generals, among them Creighton Abrams, John Vessey, and Edward C. Meyer, introduced the Total Force Policy.</description>

      <title>Pentagon Reassessing Defense Strategy under Sequestration</title>
      <author>Kristina Wong</author>
      <description>Military officials are reassessing the national defense strategy in light of spending cuts that will force the Pentagon to reduce its budget by $500 billion over the next decade, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says. "Recognizing longer-term uncertainty, I've also begun to reassess what our military strategy should be, as well as institutional reforms necessary to remain an effective fighting force," Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey wrote on his Facebook page.</description>

      <title>The Pacific "Pivot": What it Means for Language, Region, and Culture Education and Training</title>
      <author>Robert Kerr</author>
      <description>The Obama administration has made the Pacific region -- Maritime Southeast Asia in particular -- the geopolitical focus of American foreign policy for the foreseeable future.  There is good reason for this: in his 2010 book Monsoon, Robert Kaplan predicts the Indian Ocean, and most importantly the sea lanes that lead to it from the Pacific through the Straits of Malacca, will play the determining role in the United States' economic and security-related future.</description>

      <author>Matthew Cox</author>
      <description>The painful defense cuts under sequestration may last for a decade, but it's a good bet that that spending cuts won't threaten top Army programs such as the Network and the Ground Combat Vehicle. Senior Army officials, and their counterparts in other services, have talked a great deal over the past few months about the negative impacts of sequestration, a set of mandatory defense spending cuts slated to go into effect March 1.</description>

      <title>Complex Challenge of Mission Command on the Move</title>
      <author>William Wallace</author>
      <description>Command and control, battle command, mission command – no matter what term you use - the challenge is to gain information, use that information to make informed decisions, transmit those decisions across the force and monitor execution of those decisions as the mission unfolds - adjusting as necessary. Mission command is about decision-making. It is a requirement at every echelon, from squad to theater Army. It sounds simple. It is not.</description>

      <title>Hagel on Sequestration: DoD Will Adjust</title>
      <author>Andrew Tilghman</author>
      <description>Newly confirmed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel struck a comparatively reassuring tone as the so-called sequestration of defense funding formally kicked in Friday, saying the military will "adjust" to the across-the-board budget cuts that are now mandatory for all services. "Today America has the best fighting force in the world, capable of responding to any challenge," Hagel, told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday. "The management of this institution, starting with the Joint Chiefs, are not going to allow this capacity to erode."</description>

      <title>Hagel's Inaugural Address: 'We Must Deal With Budget Reality'</title>
      <author>Sandra Erwin</author>
      <description>There was no alarming doomsday rhetoric in Chuck Hagel's first speech as the nation's 24th secretary of defense. By week's end, the Pentagon will be hit by a big budget ax that will wipe out $46 billion from its 2013 budget. "That's reality," Hagel told a crowd of military officers and civilian Pentagon workers Feb. 27, just hours after being sworn into office. Budget cuts, indeed, are bad news, Hagel acknowledged. But they should not derail focus on the Pentagon's national security responsibilities, he said. "We have to deal with this reality" of fiscal austerity and political gridlock. A significant challenge for the department, he said, is uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Tanks, Aircraft Interact for Virtual Army Training</title>
      <author>Juan Carols Llorca</author>
      <description>More than a dozen troops carefully maneuver through overgrown shrubs, firing laser-tag rifles at the enemy as they advance on a compound in the New Mexico desert. Fifty miles away in West Texas, other soldiers in helicopter and tank simulators provide air and ground support for the virtual training exercise. An Army supervisor watches it all unfold on a computer screen at a Fort Bliss command center. The real mission, however, comes next: a thorough, high-tech review of the soldiers' tactics.</description>

      <title>On The Razor's Edge Of Military Readiness</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>What do the Battle of Savo Island, Kasserine Pass, Task Force Smith and Operation Eagle Claw have in common? They were all U.S. military disasters that were the result, broadly speaking, of inadequate readiness. In the first example, an allied naval force of some 22 surface warships was trounced by a Japanese flotilla one third its size in a night engagement that demonstrated the Imperial Navy's superior training, coordination and weapons.</description>

      <title>Now It's Time To Tackle The Continuing Resolution</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>Sequestration is now in effect although for how long we do not know. If it lasts for the rest of Fiscal Year 2013 it will cut approximately $85 billion from federal spending. Over the next ten years the total reduction will be about $850 billion plus another $150 billion in savings on interest payments. This is not a large cut in absolute terms. What makes sequestration particularly difficult to implement and has led to seemingly bizarre actions by some federal agencies and departments, such as releasing detained illegal immigrants, is the lack of discretion that is built into the law. With a few exceptions, every program and activity must take an equal cut and must do so out of the funds left to them for the last seven months of the fiscal year.</description>

      <title>Future Soldiers Will Have Flexible Electronics Everywhere</title>
      <author>David McNally</author>
      <description>More than 10 years ago, U.S. Army researchers saw potential in flexible displays. With nothing in the marketplace, the Army decided to change that by partnering with industry and academia to create the Flexible Display Center at Arizona State University. The Army's goal was to get this amazing technology into the hands of Soldiers. The Army established a research center with industry and universities in 2004. Fast forward nine years. Teams of researchers have scored significant breakthroughs and racked up more than 50 patents. The original goal of the program may soon be met.</description>

      <description>The Army is preparing to submit the results of an analysis of alternatives it conducted last year on its Ground Combat Vehicle program to the secretary of defense in March, according to a service official. The Army Requirements Oversight Council also is reviewing the program and will submit its requirements report to service leaders on March 1, Col. Rocky Kmiecik, of the Army's Maneuver Center of Excellence, said at the AUSA convention here.</description>

      <description>The next defense secretary will likely have to decide on a series of Army base closings to meet the challenge of looming military spending cuts, a top Army budget official said Wednesday here at the Association of the U.S. Army Winter Symposium. Outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has already pushed the revival of the Base Re-Alignment and Closure Commission, which was a vehicle for shutting down bases in the past.</description>

      <title>At Pentagon, 'Pivot to Asia' Becomes 'Shift to Africa'</title>
      <author>Craig Whitlock</author>
      <description>In his first term, President Obama instructed the Pentagon to pivot its forces and reorient its strategy toward fast-growing Asia. Instead, the U.S. military finds itself drawn into a string of messy wars in another, much poorer part of the world: Africa. Over the past two years, the Pentagon has become embroiled in conflicts in Libya, Somalia, Mali and central Africa. Meantime, the Air Force is setting up a fourth African drone base, while Navy warships are increasing their missions along the coastlines of East and West Africa.</description>

      <title>The Army's Navy: Fast Boats, Long-Range Rockets Play In Classified Wargame</title>
      <author>Sydney Freedberg</author>
      <description>For the last decade, the Army has emphasized "boots on the ground." Large numbers of foot troops slogged through valley and village, field and town, to safeguard civilians and hunt insurgents. Now, as the largest service looks beyond Afghanistan, a classified wargame about a hypothetical Korean conflict shined a spotlight on high-speed, long-range assets such as air defense missiles, guided artillery, and the Army's own fleet of boats.</description>

      <title>AUSA: Doctrine Chief Outlines Priorities for Army's Future</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>The U.S. Army's chief of doctrine development and future plans outlined the service's top priorities as it looks to again becoming an "Army of preparation," as opposed to the forward-deployed war-fighting force that is transitioning home after 12 years of combat. Gen. Robert Cone, commanding general of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, told an audience at the Association of the United States Army conference here Wednesday that while redeploying from Afghanistan, the Army needs to "readjust our focus back on the future" and begin the hard work of balancing near-term and long-term readiness.</description>

      <title>Pentagon Officials Pledge Better Communication with Industry</title>
      <author>Dan Parsons</author>
      <description>A silver lining to the coming defense downturn might be improved government-industry communications, said a senior Pentagon official. Communication broke down over the past decade when the defense budget grew by double-digit percentages annually, and there was no real incentive for contractors and Pentagon buyers to talk, said Brett Lambert, deputy assistant secretary of defense for manufacturing and industrial-base policy.</description>

      <title>Army Rethinks, Again, How to Acquire Technology</title>
      <author>Sandra Erwin</author>
      <description>A decade of war taught the Army, among other lessons, that it needed a new approach for buying information-age technologies such as computers and communications systems. Senior Army leaders in 2011 introduced with great fanfare a nontraditional plan for acquiring wireless networks for combat brigades. The centerpiece of the strategy are "network integration evaluations" where soldiers get to test every widget before the Army buys it. NIEs also, for the first time, allowed the Army to put together and test all the pieces of an information network at once, rather than wait for troops to experiment with new systems while in combat.</description>

      <title>U.S. Army Wants More Switchblades</title>
      <author>Paul McLeary</author>
      <description>Pentagon officials are reviewing a joint urgent needs statement for the lightweight, tube-launched, Lethal Miniature Aerial Munitions Systems (LMAMS) — better known as the Switchblade — for use in Afghanistan, U.S. Army officials told Defense News. While declining to give specifics on the number of systems that commanders in Afghanistan have requested, Col. Pete Newell, the Rapid Equipping Force's (REF) director, said it was more than his budget could handle.</description>

      <title>Is A Hollow Military Better Than One That Is Too Small?</title>
      <author>Daniel Goure, Ph.D.</author>
      <description>With the sequestration doomsday clock clicking ever closer to midnight, the Pentagon has weighed in with its apocalyptic predictions. As described in text and multi-colored charts, the services will respond to sequestration by, in part, furloughing hundreds of thousands of civilian employees, eliminating planned maintenance events for hundreds of ships, planes and vehicles, reducing training activities, cutting flying hours, ending 24/7 missile warning and space surveillance radar operations, reducing forward presence forces and curtailing major modernization programs.</description>

      <title>Army Arms Every Division With Gray Eagle</title>
      <author>Joe Gould and Michelle Tan</author>
      <description>The Army is planning to give Gray Eagle drones to 15 of its companies, a move that will give divisions new theater-level long-range, high-endurance reconnaissance and extended standoff attack capabilities.The massive MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone can fly for 24 hours, as high as 25,000 feet, and it can carry four Hellfire missiles. Soldiers in the cockpit of the new Apache AH-64E will have the ability to use the UAV's sensors to observe the battlefield and fire those missiles — all while safe and far away.</description>
