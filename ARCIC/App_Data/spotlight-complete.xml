       This is the second of three articles discussing multi-domain battle through the lens of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command published in Military Review. This article discusses the rationale and the approach for incorporating aspects of multi-domain battle into Field Manual 3-0, Army Operations, due to be published October 2017. In recognition of the centennial of American Expeditionary Forces entering World War I, the articles incorporate relevant historical observations and lessons to help drive home the new and differentiate it from the old.

      <imageCaption>
        <![CDATA[
       <p>
       To be ready for the next war, the U.S. Army and the other services must effectively innovate and adapt concepts, equipment, and training. The future battlefield will be one where integration into joint and multinational forces is a prerequisite for victory. To get there, we must establish a clear path to prepare the force for the fight tonight, tomorrow, and in the future.  Multi-Domain Battle is key to getting the U.S. military into shape for that fight.</p>
     <p>To put Multi-Domain Battle into action, the U.S. Army is committed to making considerable strides by the beginning of FY 2018. These achievements will include incorporating current capability with concept requirements, developing doctrine to guide today’s force, and detailing a full concept by which we can frame future discussions and efforts. By conducting this journey in stride with our partners in the Joint Force, we will ensure transparency, cohesion, and shared understanding. Ultimately, it is our intent that our future efforts will provide the conceptual foundation to design and field the most capable multi-domain combat forces and serve as a collaborative point of departure for shared initiatives across the joint force.  </p>

        <![CDATA[
       <p>ARCIC hosted the How the Army Fights IV (HTAF IV) Senior Leader Seminar on Aug. 2, 2017 at Ft. Eustis, VA as part of the TRADOC Commander's Forum; all Center of Excellence Commanding Generals and Directors of Capabilities Development and Integration Directorates (CDIDs) took part in the wargame.  The preparatory main learning event, the Council of Colonels seminar wargame, was 10-14 Jul at Carlisle Barracks, PA.  HTAF IV examined the competition phase at the operational level against a peer adversary in the year 2035.  Using the emerging Multi-Domain Battle (MDB) concept as the framework, HTAF IV examined actions required for Army expeditionary and forward-postured forces in 2035 to deter, defeat, and transform denied spaces into contested spaces.  HTAF IV incorporated more robust joint and multifunctional capabilities than previous HTAF events, providing a bridge to Unified Quest 2018: MDB as the Foundation of the Future Joint Force.</p>

        <p>Fort Eustis, Virginia – Gen. David G. Perkins, Commanding General of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, hosted a delegation from Israel to participate in the 26th Future Battlefield Annual Talks, or FBAT, 4-8 June 2017. </p>
       <p>TRADOC’s relationship with the Israel Defense Forces began in 1973 following the Yom Kippur War, leading to the FBAT’s initiation in 1988. The TRADOC commanding general has served as U.S. head of delegation since 1990. Each year, FBAT is held alternately between locations in the U.S. and Israel.</p>
         <p>In addition to the TRADOC commanding general, this year's U.S. delegation also included Sgt. Maj. David Davenport, TRADOC’s command Sgt. Maj.; LTG Sean McFarland, Deputy Commanding General TRADOC; LTG Michael Lundy, Commanding General U.S Army Combined Arms Center and MG Robert “Bo” Dyess, Acting Director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center. The delegation also included leadership from the Maneuver, Fires, Sustainment, Maneuver Support, Aviation, Intelligence and Mission Command Centers of Excellence and selected school commandants.</p>
       <p>Maj. Gen. Yacov Barak, Chief of the IDF Ground Forces, served as the Israeli head of delegation.</p>
      
      
      <p class="caption small">The Future Battlefield Annual Talks XXVI delegation at Fort Eustis, VA for the plenary session phase of the FBAT.  The FBAT head of delegation included Gen. Perkins and Maj. Gen. Barak (center). </p>
      
      <p>From 4-6 June, IDF Ground Forces Delegates visited their counterparts at Maneuver, CYBER, Fires, Mission Command, and Maneuver Support Centers of Excellence to gain insights into the curriculum, technology and techniques used to train U.S. Soldiers. The counterparts shared their army's respective approaches and lessons on a wide range of warfighting themes. These engagements provided the opportunity for the representatives of each Army to share their approaches and lessons learned to develop leaders and maintain the edge against adversaries. During the "counterpart days," GEN Perkins and MG Barak visited the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning, GA. While at Fort Benning, they engaged Captains participating in the Maneuver Captain Career Course.  This was one of the highlights of MG Barak’s visit. The young officers reminded him of his own junior leaders. From there, they visited Wood Simulation Center to observe the Common Driver Trainer (CDT), Call for fire trainer (CFFT), Long Range Advanced Scout Sensor LRAS Training, and Engagement Skills Trainer (EST2).  The last stop was Clarke Simulation Center where they observed the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS), Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3), Conduct of Fire Trainer (COFT), and Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT).  MG Barak commented that had envisioned a simulation capability for the IDF Ground Forces and was amazed that it already existed at Fort Benning. They finished the day with a tour and dinner in the National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center.  The next day MG Barak and GEN Perkins visited a stress shoot to observe gender integration in a field environment.</p>
      <p>The culminating plenary session had the IDF and the IDF and US Army delegates presenting a series of briefs with discussion on a wide range of topics.  The US delegation covered Russian New Generation Warfare, Multi Domain Battle, Cyber Branch developments, and Tactical Command Posts, while the IDF covered their Digital Army Program, Logistics developments and what they are calling the spherical threat.  MG Barak also described the significant force generation and organizational improvements underway to increase readiness across their joint force.  GEN Perkins reiterated the importance of FBAT to the U.S. Army and how TRADOC greatly values the long standing partnership with the IDF Ground Forces. </p>
      <p>The plenary session ended with GEN Perkins and MG Barak co-signing a memorandum codifying the next FBAT and the 2017-2018 CoE military-to-military agreed-to-actions. </p>
      <p>The FBAT concluded on 8 June 17 with a cultural visit to Yorktown Battlefield Historical Park. GEN Perkins and MG Barak participated in a cannon firing demonstration while at the Battlefield Park.</p>
      <p>The Israelis will host the 27th annual FBAT in 2018.  This critical engagement remains a premier learning venue that benefits both the IDF and the U.S. Army. Furthermore, the FBAT continues to demonstrate the long-standing partnership and commitment between the Armies.</p>

        <![CDATA[
        <p>More than 200 military and civilian experts gathered at Carlisle Barracks May 3-12 to examine the Multi-Domain Battle concept during the annual Unified Quest Deep Future Wargame. During the wargame, six working groups focused on how the Army could fight across multiple domains in the 2030-2050 timeframe as part of a joint, inter-organizational and multinational force. Using a realistic scenario, the working groups provided recommendations for and an understanding of concepts and capabilities that posture Army forces to deter and defeat a peer adversary in the future. Insights from the Deep Future Wargame will be further explored in future Army's Campaign of Learning events and presented to senior leaders in July. Unified Quest continues to explore the Multi-Domain Battle concept next year focused on how multi-domain battle applies to the joint force.</p>

         The third preparatory event for the UQ17 Deep Future Wargame, the "Core Planning Group," saw the development of operational approaches for three joint task forces which will examine how to create and exploit temporary windows of advantage, build and sustain resilient formations, and conduct operations in complex and urban terrain. An additional working group focused on solving anti-access/area denial problems. To prepare them for their tasks, all participants received information on multi-domain battle, the future operational environment, Army Functional Concepts, and scenario-based threats.  The attendees used short situational training exercises (STXs) to familiarize them with friendly future formations and capabilities developed during the Future Force Design III workshop in late March, and how they might operate in a given situation. The participants will bring the results of the Core Planning Group event to the Unified Quest 2017 Deep Future Wargame in early May where the participants will examine how their work will inform the emerging Multi-Domain Battle concept and other concepts to assist Army leaders in making decisions about the future force and how to

U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and Georgia Tech Research Institute will co-host the Mad Scientist Conference: Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy in Multi-Domain Battle 2030-2050 at the Georgia Tech Research Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, March 7-8.
 
The event will explore two themes: how artificial intelligence and robotics are changing the relationship between humans and warfare, and how robotics, artificial intelligence and autonomous systems enable the U.S. military and its adversaries in multi-domain warfare.

Because of advancement in these technologies, war between 2030 and 2050 is predicted to be contested simultaneously in all five domains: air, land, maritime, space and cyberspace.

Tune in here on 7 and 8 March: www.tradoc.army.mil/watch Get in the game- the wargame- participate in an ideation exercise in partnership with SciTechFutures and ASA(ALT) Check the flyer out.

The International Fellows included senior officers from more than 30 countries. During their visit to TRADOC headquarters, the fellows received briefings from the Army Capabilities Integration Center and other staff directorates on the direction of the U.S. Army's current and future force, which included a discussion on Multi-Domain Battle and how to transform an army. Each year, the USAWC allows International Fellows to visit various commands, forces and organizations to expose the fellows to senior-level strategic perspectives. (U.S. Army photo by Clayton Weis)

				Human Performance Seminar
			</imageTitle>
			<imageCaption>
				The future operational environment, the changing character of war and how
the Army will fight in 2035-2050 present challenges to future forces that
may require new ways to recruit, assess, train, and educate Soldiers,
leaders and civilians. The Army needs an understanding of the attributes
future forces require to maintain overmatch in the physical, mental and
moral components of human performance of land warfare.  In December 2016,
the Human Dimension Division, along with TRADOC's Future Warfare Division as
part of Unified Quest, hosted the Human Performance Seminar to determine the
human performance requirements given the anticipated future operational
environment, and the demands placed on the force by Multi-Domain Battle and
the Movement and Maneuver functional concept. The outcomes will inform
future human performance seminars, engage Army social science researchers
(ARI, ARL-HRED, etc.), and lead to revisions of the Human Dimension Concept
and Strategy.

				Character of Future War Seminar
			</imageTitle>
			<imageCaption>
				In November 2016, Unified Quest hosted a seminar to examine the character of
				war in 2035 in terms of required capabilities, attributes, concepts, and
				implications for the future operating environment. This event addressed
				comments the Army Chief of Staff made during a January 2016 Unified Quest
				event; he stated he foresees changes in the character of war, warfighting
				technologies, demographics, economics, and geopolitical conditions that will
				change the conduct of military operations.  Results from the Character of
				Future War Seminar helps the Army develop a service-wide understanding that
				describes the 2035 operating environment, supports further refinement of
				Army concepts, and, when combined with the results of the December 2016
				Human Performance Seminar, will provide future force attribute
				recommendations on three levels: the Army, small teams, and individual
				soldiers.  Consolidated findings from the seminar will inform solution
				strategies to build the future force and develop a Vision of Future
				Conflict.

			</imageTitle>
			<imageCaption>
				TRADOC hosted How the Army Fights Seminar II at Ft Eustis, Aug. 24.  More than 90 senior leaders from throughout the command discussed the character of warfare in 2030 and how the Army could fight in that operational environment.  The seminar began with a two-day council of colonels who explored the Movement and Maneuver functional concepts, employment in a realistic 2030 scenario to identify potential gaps and draft solutions to refine those concepts.  The final day, general officers gathered in a forum hosted by GEN Perkins to provide senior leader insights on the concept gaps and solutions.   HTAF is a scenario-based event that uses the draft Multi-Domain Battle White Paper and draft Army Functional Concept for Movement and Maneuver as the foundation for exploration of how the Army could operate as part of a Joint force at the tactical and operational levels.  These seminars are quarterly events to advance understanding of how the Army will fight in the future.

				The Unified Challenge 16.1 and 16.2 (UC16.1 &amp; UC16.2) Game-based Experiments (GAMEXp) provides a venue designed to describe the capabilities required by the Theater Army, Corps and Divisions and inform Initial operational and organizational Concepts (O&amp;Os) development. These O&amp;Os will be used to structure the Army's future force, determine how they are equipped and design the doctrine they will use to fight. Unified Challenge incorporates the results from other venues from the F2025 Campaign of Learning (CoL). Over 200 participants at Mission Control Battle Lab (MCBL) Fort Leavenworth Kansas and seven distributed locations, from the Air Force, Marines, EUCOM, CENTCOM, PACOM, ARCENT, USAEUR, DA G-8, FORSCOM, ARCYBER, ARNG, AMC, USASOC, United Kingdom and TRADOC working to inform the formations of the future.

				 Deep Future Wargame in 2030.
			</imageTitle>
			<imageCaption>
				The purpose of the Deep Future Wargame was to determine how operational and organizational concepts perform within multiple scenarios across the range of military operations in 2030. Four regionally focused working groups wargamed scenario extracts through three phases of the operation within each respective campaign. A dedicated cell performed global, integrated operations to assess capacity of Army forces to operate during near-simultaneous operations. The Deep Future Wargame took place May 5-12 in Carlisle Barracks, PA.
				Concurrently with the Deep Future Wargame, a second wargame looked at the far future of 2050.  The purpose of the Future Operational Environment Wargame was to enable Army leaders to understand, visualize, describe, direct lease, and assess future force development efforts.  This event ran May 4-12.  This seminar wargame looked at the characteristics of the future operational environment  to identify gaps and opportunities to drive the development of the force of 2050.
				At the end of the wargames, a combined outbrief presented the initial insights derived from the games to the Chief of Staff of the Army and more than 40 other general officers and senior executive service leaders. These insights will be further developed in the next series of Unified Quest events.

				The purpose of the Unified Quest How the Army Fights seminar was to enable senior leaders to visualize and describe how the Army could fight in the future contested environment.  The event took place at Fort Benning, GA on 24 February 2016.  In the first stage, a Council of Colonels Working Group, consisting of more than 40 participants from across the joint, interagency and multinational community, reviewed and rehearsed the planned senior leader presentation.  In the second stage, over 150 general officers, senior executive service civilians, command sergeants major, and other senior leaders conducted a discussion of the deep, close, and security fight in a scenario set in 2030.  This discussion identified a series of challenges to the Army’s ability to Win in a Complex World presented by the scenario.  This event was the first of an upcoming series of How the Army Fights seminars that will be tied to TRADOC Commander's Forums.   Future seminars will focus on particular problem sets, gaps, capability implications, and actionable decisions.

			<imageTitle>New TRADOC G-9 'Engagement' Role</imageTitle>
			<imageCaption>In October 2014, the Army Capabilities Integration Center's (ARCIC) Information Integration Directorate moved to the staff, as the "G-9," for ARCIC's senior command, the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). This expanded the organization's portfolio of ARCIC communications and outreach support to include broader TRADOC strategic engagement priorities. "The genesis in what is really an expansion in our mission came from the TRADOC senior leadership," said Mr. Rickey Smith, TRADOC Deputy Chief of Staff, G-9. He explained there was a question among leaders: How could TRADOC improve its output as an extension of the Army Staff supporting both the Secretary and Chief of the Army? Developing TRADOC G-9 was the answer. G-9 will help key decision makers and their staffs work with TRADOC to address mutual challenges and build a common understanding for how to address the complex environment in which Soldiers must operate. As the only TRADOC organization inside the national capital region, G-9 helps to ensure TRADOC remains effectively involved in the intellectual discussions shaping the Army.</imageCaption>

			<imageCaption>Maj. Gen. Hans-Christian Mathiesen, the new Danish Chief of Staff of the Army, hosted Maj. Gen. William Hix, ARCIC Deputy Director, at his biannual commander's Conference in Karup, Denmark on Nov. 3-4. One of the Danish CSA's objectives was to inspire and engage the Danish Army leadership in frank discussions on matters of mutual interest relative to "Perspectives on future operational environment and Army concepts development." MG Hix spoke on the topic of Force 2025 and Beyond. This engagement was a follow up to the senior leader dialogue during the Danish Chief of Staff of the Army visit to TRADOC HQ in the Spring of 2014 and it reinforces the close bonds shared between the Danish Army and U.S. Army.
