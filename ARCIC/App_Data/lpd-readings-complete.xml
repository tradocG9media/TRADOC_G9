    <p>Team,</p>
    <p>Army leaders use the Think – Learn – Analyze – Implement paradigm to drive Army modernization and develop the future force. Army leaders Think clearly about future conflict to establish a sound conceptual foundation of the future. As such the Multi-Domain Battle concept provides the starting point for Army modernization by describing how future forces will fight and by identifying the required capabilities they will require to execute operations.  Army leaders then Learn from experiments, wargames, and assessments to refine capability gaps and ensure that capabilities are sound, complete, and integrated. Experimentation that occurs in a focused, sustained, and collaborative manner as well, as the follow on analysis, ensures that the Army makes sound investments that improve both the current and programmed forces' ability to conduct operations.   Ultimately, modernization and experimentation are inseparable.</p>
    <p>This week's professional “reading” provides a historical perspective on how our Army used experiments to improve operational effectiveness. In "The Big Picture: Combat Developments Experimentation Command," a video produced by the Army in 1964 as part of its "The Big Picture" series, the narrator highlights the importance of experiments and wargame as well as the role of the Combat Developments Experimentation Command (CDEC), a subordinate command of the Combat Developments Command (CDC).  According to Department of the Army Reorganization Planning 10-1, dated March 1962, “Future doctrinal and organizational concepts require, operations research studies, feasibility tests, war gaming and field experimentation.” To achieve that end CDEC leaders considered “new trends and events” to determine how they intended to fight future wars and then developed experiments to examine capability effectiveness. After critically analyzing their findings leaders presented recommendations to Army leadership.   While the video depicts units, equipment, and capabilities from a bygone era, the process depicted in the video essentially remains unchanged today.  </p>
    <p>Much of the successful experimentation depicted in the video depended on a dedicated experimental unit.  The historical record indicates that experimentation with a dedicated unit has played a major role in the transformation of Army forces over the course of the last century. During the 1960s, for example, the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) was instrumental to integrating helicopters into the force. In the 1980s the 9th Infantry Division examined the efficacy of motorized infantry.  Until recently, the Army’s dedicated unit for experimentation was 2d Brigade, 1st Armor Division however increasing operational requirements necessitated its return to an operational role.  Successful experimentation enables leaders to not only understand the problem of future war, but also enables them to assess how the changing character of warfare will impact concepts and capabilities.  </p>
    <p>During the coming year, the Army is preparing to undergo its largest organizational transformation since the establishment of TRADOC and FORSCOM, to “establish unity of command and unity of effort that consolidates the modernization process under one roof.” The Army’s history of experiments and experimental units demonstrated a vital link in the pursuit of new weapon systems and new ways to fight.  Experimentation enables disruption - the messy, chaotic work that is the hallmark of an innovative organization. 
The Army’s capstone experiment is the Joint Warfighting Analysis (JWA).  Conducted by the Joint Modernization Command (JMC), JWA provides a venue for the Army to demonstrate and assess concepts and capabilities required for a more lethal force.  JMC, in partnership with USAREUR and (ASA(ALT), will execute JWA 18.1 in Germany at the Grafenwohr and Hohenfels Training Areas between 5 Feb and 22 Jun 2018. Completion of JWA will accelerate force modernization efforts and enhance the Army’s ability to fight and win against a peer competitor.

    <p>Team,</p>
    <p>Although conflict and violence remain immutable to the nature of war, the methods through which nations pursue political goals continue to evolve and change. How the changing character of conflict manifests and what the Army must do to prepare for tomorrow requires our continued study of the profession of arms to learn how today’s world will shape tomorrow’s conflicts.  Prescience isn’t perfect.   As the historian Sir Michael Howard observed, “No matter how clearly one thinks, it is impossible to anticipate precisely the character of future conflict.” While we cannot predict the future; we can anticipate based on observable trends. But as Howard warned, “The key is to not be so far off the mark that it becomes impossible to adjust once that character is revealed.”  </p>
       <p>Anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict. Technological advances and changes in strategic guidance, joint operating concepts, and security challenges require the U.S. Army to innovate to ensure that forces are prepared to accomplish future missions. Shifts in the geopolitical landscape caused by competition for power and resources influence the character of armed conflict. These shifts, and violence associated with them, occur more rapidly than in the past due to advances in technology, the proliferation of information, and the associated increased momentum of human interaction.  As stated in the Army Operating Concept, “the character of future warfare evolves based upon assigned missions; the operational environment; emerging technologies; and changes in enemy capabilities, objectives, and will.”</p> 
       <p>In this week’s professional reading, “An Advanced Engagement Battlespace: Tactical, Operational and Strategic Implications for the Future Operational Environment” the TRADOC G2 explores the operational environment and the changing character of conflict by analyzing the implications at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.    TRADOC G2’s essay contends that future conflicts, referred to as engagements in the essay, share a common premise: advances in sensing, precision attack, and decision-making will fundamentally alter the character of future conflict.  The essay argues that  future conflict will be compressed in time, as the speed of weapon delivery and their associated effects accelerate enormously; extended in space, in many cases to a global extent, via precision long-range strike and interconnectedness, particularly in the information environment; and far more lethal, by virtue of ubiquitous sensors, proliferated precision, high kinetic energy weapons and advanced area munitions; routinely interconnected – and contested -- across the multiple domains of air, land, sea, space and cyber.  The essay further argues that future conflict will be interactive across the multiple dimensions of conflict, not only across every domain in the physical dimension, but also the cognitive dimension of information operations, and even the moral dimension of belief and values. </p> 
       <p>The essay concludes by illustrating the importance of concepts, integrating capabilities, and learning.  Concepts build on what is timeless and enduring: joint and combined arms warfare will be even more potent because of the increased potential for cross-domain synergy.  Future synchronization challenges will be far more daunting because cause and effect must be orchestrated across multiple domains but since Special Operations Forces, conventional forces, interagency and multinational partners will operate alongside one another in ill-defined environments they require interoperability, integration, and interdependence far greater than what is achieved today.  </p> 
       <p>TRADOC G2’s essay provides insights important to the continuing development of the Multi-Domain Battle concept.  Army leaders develop and mature concepts for future armed conflict, assess concepts in experimentation and other learning activities, and use what is learned to drive future force development.  The Multi-Domain Battle concept will guide and inform subsequent concepts and activities that develop doctrine, organizations, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) capabilities.

         <!--HEADER-->           
    <p>Team,</p>
     <p>One of our most important duties as Army professionals is to think clearly about future armed conflict. That is because our vision of the future must drive change to ensure that our Army is prepared to prevent conflict, shape the security environment, and win wars.  Since the Army cannot predict who and where it will fight it must anticipate changes in the character of warfare and adapt quickly to these changes to ensure that Army forces are manned, trained, and equipped to overmatch future enemies and potential adversaries.  Adaptation is responding to new needs or changes without a loss of functionality. Because the acceleration of technological change is outpacing the ability of DOD acquisition systems to develop and field capabilities, the Army must ensure that it is capable of developing materiel solutions much faster than in the past in order to provide the foundational capabilities that enable the Joint Force to prevent conflict. Ultimately, the Army must adapt and innovate faster than enemies and potential adversaries. 

</p>
<p>The CSA’s announcement at the AUSA national meeting that Acting Secretary McCarthy “approved the concept of a new modernization or futures command, to consolidate the processes…and put them all under one roof,” signifies that the Army is no longer willing to accept the status quo.  As Secretary McCarthy and General Milley highlight in their 3 October 2017 message to the force titled, “Army Modernization Priorities” the status quo is adherence to a modernization process that is “an Industrial Age model, staff-centric and stove-piped, overly bureaucratic and slow, and not organized to deliver modern, critical capabilities to Soldiers quickly.”  History is replete with military organizations that maintained the status quo but failed to recognize that their inability, reticence, or failure to adapt led to defeat on the battlefield. This week’s professional reading offers a timely typology of the factors that influence organizational change. To successfully implement change, it is essential to not only understand the underlying factors that influence change but also its implications. </p>
 <p></p>  
  <p>In this week’s professional reading, “Adapting to Strategic Change: Organizational Change and Adaptation in the US Army,” LTC J.P. Clark examines a conceptual framework that explains why organizational changes occur then applies the framework to today’s Army to explore whether significant changes remain in the distant future or if a shift is already underway. After examining the scholarship on military adaptation Clark posits that the current scholarship tends to focus on deliberate attempts by military organizations to adapt themselves. This literature identifies three main models for such change: external direction overcomes military conservatism; a visionary leader provides internal direction; and the Army as an institution reacts to an external shock such as defeat in war. Clark contends these existing explanations tend to work best when used to understand short-term, discrete instances of change, such as an institutional reorganization or update to doctrine.</p>
   <p>Clark argues that something additional is needed to understand more fundamental, long-term shifts in professional norms. He proposes that such seismic changes are typically the product of a generational shift arising from a combination of three broad categories of influence: institutions, experiences, and culture. When combined, Clark contends, they satisfactorily explain discrete instances of change, such as an institutional reorganization.  Observing that transformational change is the result of a series of generational shifts, Clark demonstrates that the impetus for large shifts in professional norms can be grouped into three broad categories of influence: institutions, experiences, and culture.  Institutions refer to the mechanisms by which a military deliberately attempts to shape its profession such as the curricula of military schools or policies governing the selection of officers.  Experiences encompass all elements of military service that shape perceptions but remain external to institutional control.  Culture includes everything else: the values, concepts, and outlooks inherited from civilian society.  The institutions-experiences-culture framework enables military practitioners to better describe the inputs into the profession and discern deliberate efforts to change from those that happened in response to external forces. </p>
       
    <p>Clark concludes his essay with recommendations on how organizations can handle adaptation: </p>
      <div>1)  Acknowledge the nature and intractability of generational differences.  Generational conflict occurs when an organization contains groups that have undergone significantly dissimilar formative experiences and so consequently operate in accord with different sets of core beliefs. Compromise might be reached upon ancillary matters but not on the kind of fundamental issues that define generations.</div>
       <p>
       2) Use training and education to complement experience.  Training and education are the most direct means of shaping the profession, but they are not all powerful.  If training and education are to impart a broader perspective, schools and training centers must first crack that shell of certainty by challenging individuals to reassess strongly held beliefs.</p>
        <p>3) Guard against identical backgrounds. The Army that stakes its future upon a narrow set of skills and attributes risks disaster when the character of warfare renders that core less relevant, or even obsolete.</p>
         <p>4) Encourage diverse experiences. Personnel policies, another important tool of institutional control, foster adaptation by making use of the broad base of experience already resident within the institution.</p>
          <p>5) Communicate assumptions.  Whatever the issue at stake in any generational conflict, senior leaders should articulate the assumptions that frame their views while seeking to understand the foundation of the younger generation’s perspective.</p>
          
          <p>6) Practice prudence and humility. Prudence and humility are ultimately the greatest keys to adaptation.

	This week’s essay reminds us that change is difficult.  “The need to change will ever be with us,” noted General Starry “But that in no way ensures either that change will occur or that it will be an easy, orderly process.”  While members of Congress appear to support the Army’s effort, the greatest resistance is likely to originate from within the ranks.  Antagonists will resist change due to various reasons:  historical experience, conservatism, an inability to evaluate new ideas, and in some cases, the desire by some to preserve the status quo out of fear of losing personal or professional power or prestige.  But as Clark points out, those who are accustomed to the status quo and “regard the change as one for the worse, a betrayal of what they hold dear” will be replaced by a new generation who “cannot fathom how their predecessors could have been so backward.”

    <p>Team,</p>
    <p>U.S. military dominance is increasingly contested in the land, air, maritime, space and cyberspace domains. While the U.S. has been engaged in counter-insurgency operations for the last 15 years, potential adversaries have modernized and studied how we fight, and will seek to threaten our critical capabilities through multiple domains. Multi-Domain Battle is an emerging concept with our Joint partners to help maintain American military dominance in a battlefield that is extended into all five domains - land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace, and across the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
    <p>In this week’s professional reading, “Extending the Battlefield,” General Donn A. Starry describes the extended battlefield concept he envisioned necessary to engage Soviet second echelon and follow-on forces.  General Starry’s challenge was not unlike the challenge posed to the United States of a future battlefield expanded across multiple domains.  Recognizing this threat, MG Bill Hix, Director of Strategy, Plans, and Policy for the Army G-3/5/7, recently emphasized (1) the Army must begin aggressively restructuring, reorganizing, and modernizing to meet the challenges posed by near-peer adversaries such as Russia and China.  He further stated that counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations have shaped Army force structure, defined system development, and focused science and technology efforts “on near-term requirements” and that during the same time Russia and China have embarked on major military modernization efforts and have significantly closed the capabilities gap with the U.S.  He concluded that those investments now pose a risk to the Army in “every domain of war” and that “a deliberate examination of how the Army should reorganize is long overdue. Hard thinking, aggressive study and concept development, coupled with science and technology programs to develop options” for the next two decades “will ensure the U.S. Army is favorably disposed to meet this future head-on.”  Multi-Domain Battle is the emerging multi-service concept to meet these future challenges.   </p>
     <p>Although GEN Starry’s article has a primary focus on the integration off deep strike capabilities, Starry offers several ideas important to the development of the emerging Multi-Domain Battle (MDB) concept.  First, MDB, building on the Army Operating Concept (AOC), must enable the military to win.  He argues that once “political authorities commit military forces in pursuit of political aims, military forces must win or there is no basis from which political authorities can bargain to win politically.”  He states that the purpose of military operations “cannot be to simply avert defeat, but, rather, it must be to win.”  </p>
      <p>Second, Starry describes a battlefield that is extended in both depth and forward in time.  As such he describes the need to conduct operations across the breadth and depth of the battle field simultaneously to maximize the likelihood of winning the close-in battle over time.  Applying Starry’s notion of extended depth and time to today’s changing operating environment, rapidly evolving technologies, and adversaries’ adaptations to them requires consideration of battlespace convergence and compression.  Converged battlespace is a product of the adversary’s ability to integrate capabilities across many domains, environments, and functions in time to achieve effects at any geographic location. The ability of adversaries to both extend the battlespace and converge capabilities compresses the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war for Joint Force and allied commanders.  Thus, strategic to tactical compression is a result of adversaries’ extended-range of conventional capabilities, information warfare, and unconventional capabilities that place friendly formations at risk from multiple systems, both lethal and nonlethal, operating in dispersed locations, often outside the range of the friendly formation’s systems and authority.  Multi-domain battle must consider how to overcome this compression shortens friendly commanders’ decision cycles and severely inhibits the Joint Force’s ability to identify, maneuver on, and isolate adversary capabilities geographically, functionally, or by domain.</p>
       <p>Third, Starry argues that the “capability to conduct extended attacks must be an integral part of every combat unit’s capability.”  This is important because the goal of collapsing the enemy’s ability to fight requires a unified employment of a wide range of systems and organizations. To conduct Multi-Domain Battle, all domains and warfighting functions must be integrated to deliver a holistic solution to the problem.  Because Multi-Domain Battle extends the battlespace to strategic areas for both friendly and enemy forces, it expands the targeting landscape based on the extended ranges and lethality delivered at range by integrated air defenses, cross-domain fire support, and cyber/electronic warfare systems.</p>
        <p>Finally, Starry argues that the extended battlefield concept was necessary to serve as a “unifying idea which pulls all these emerging capabilities together so that, together, they can allow us to realize their full combined potential for winning.”  He further argued that “the time for implementation is now.”  In concert with MG Hix’s statement that we conduct “hard thinking, aggressive study and concept development, coupled with science and technology programs to develop options”, Starry emphasized that now was the time to field and learn to use the concept on the ground with real troops, real equipment, and the real world problems of field commanders.”      </p>
         <p>Today, current U.S. force posture, coupled with the demand for globally integrated operations, presents a myriad of challenges to regional Joint Force Commanders tasked to contest and defeat peer adversaries in support of U.S. national interests. To mitigate these challenges, the U.S. Joint Force must evolve its combined arms mindset to incorporate capabilities from all Services and functions, operating in all domains and environments to develop comprehensive and complementary combined arms solutions for periods of competition below armed conflict and during armed conflict.  As a “unifying idea,” Multi-Domain Battle Concept is an important collaborative and innovative effort across our Services that we will ensure our forces are prepared to “win” short of armed conflict when possible, and to prevail against our adversaries when war is unavoidable.       </p>   
         <p>During the AUSA National Symposium and Exposition, GEN Perkins will lead a group of esteemed panelists in a discussion on Multi-Domain Battle.   The panel is titled "Converged and Integrated Solutions for the Future" and will be live-streamed for those unable to attend the event.  </p>

    <p>Team,</p>
    <p>To execute operations in future conflicts, our Army must innovate to develop capabilities that enables us to accomplish future missions as part of the Joint Force.  Innovation is the act or process of introducing something new, or creating new uses for existing designs.  Innovation is not invention.  To innovate, Army leaders drive the development of new tools or methods that permit Army forces to retain overmatch against determined enemies and adversaries.  Moreover, successful innovation requires focused and sustained collaboration across the Army, the joint community, industry, academia, and other inter-organizational and multinational partners.</p>
    <p>During future conflicts Army forces execute Multi-Domain Battle to ensure Joint Force freedom of action and deny the enemy the ability to operate freely across those domains by maneuvering and projecting power across all domains.  The Army’s ability to execute multi-domain operations is essential to the Joint Force’s ability to achieve objectives consistent with U.S. interests and foreign policy. The U.S. Army Functional Concept for Movement and Maneuver requires that future Army forces, as part of the Joint Force, be mobile and maneuver dispersed with the ability to concentrate combat power rapidly at decisive points and in spaces (domains) to achieve operational objectives. Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) must have the capability to deploy and operate semi-independently in order to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative by attacking from multiple locations, directions, and domains to present dilemmas to the enemy throughout the depth of the battlefield.  BCTs, therefore, require innovative solutions that enable them to operate semi-independently for sustained periods during future conflicts.  </p>
    <p>This week’s professional reading highlights an innovation that may hold promise for future Army forces. In “Army showcases stealthy, hydrogen fuel cell vehicle,” David Vergun provides an overview of the ZH2 hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle that is the result of a collaborative effort between General Motors (GM) and the Army’s Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC).  The ZH2 is a modified, street-legal Chevy Colorado that is fitted with a hydrogen fuel cell and electric drive.  Instead of using batteries like most electric vehicles, electricity is generated from compressed hydrogen that is stored in the vehicle by an electrochemical reaction.  According to Vergun, the ZH2 provides several benefits that may be useful to future soldiers:  </p>
    <p>- The ZH2 produces high torque and comes equipped with 37-inch tires that enable it to negotiate rough and steep terrain.</p>
    <p>- The hydrogen fuel cell can produce two gallons per hour of potable water.</p>
    <p>- When the vehicle isn't moving, it can generate 25 kilowatts of continuous power or 50 kW of peak power. There are 120 and 240-volt outlets located in the trunk.</p>
    <p>The ZH2 is not the first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle used by the military but it is the first developed for tactical situations.  Throughout 2017 the Army and GM have been testing the ZH2 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Benning, Georgia; Quantico Marine Base, Virginia; and, GM's own Proving Grounds in Michigan.  </p>
    <p>Through collaborative efforts such as the one that produced the ZH2, fuel cell technology will continue to evolve and improve.  While the ZH2 is only a prototype, Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles hold promise for not only improving stealth but also for decreasing future logistics demand.   Demand consists of operational requirements for services or commodities beyond a unit’s organic ability to produce or acquire independently that enables freedom of action, extends operational reach, or prolongs its endurance.    Demand reduction objectives consist of the following:</p>
    <p>- Improve Effectiveness and Efficiency.  Reduce consumption across all classes of supply in formations by providing commanders with holistically developed formations equipped with energy efficient platforms; manned and maneuvered by Soldiers using demand sensitive tactics, techniques and procedures; and led by consumption informed and educated leaders. </p>
     <p>-	Meet Demand at the Point of Need. Reducing vulnerabilities inherent in deployment and sustainment activities supports resiliency of U.S. Forces. Dispersed, distributed, and resilient force deployment and sustainment using multiple lines of communications will reduce vulnerability to interdiction.</p>
    <p>- Employ Robotics and Autonomous Systems. Just as robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) are transforming the private sector, these capabilities have the potential to transform many aspects of military operations.</p>
    <p>Improve Situational Awareness.   Development of an automated fuel management system, condition based maintenance plus, and automated sustainment tools that are capable of performing predictive analysis will allow supplies to be pushed forward to units at the right time and to the right location. Additionally, sustainment information systems must also be interoperable with mission command systems to have a robust common operating picture.</p>
     <p>To meet demand reduction objectives with this technology the hydrogen that fuels the ZH2 must be produced closer to the point of demand.  Through sustained collaboration the Army will be able to develop innovative solutions to decrease demand to the point of need, which will be critical to the Army’s ability to execute Multi-Domain Battle during future conflicts.

    <p>The ZH2 Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicle will be on display at the AUSA Annual Meeting and Exposition 9-11 Oct in Washington, DC.  It will also be at TRADOC Headquarters on 13 October.  All are invited to view the vehicle and speak with its developers.

         <!--HEADER-->  
        
      <p>Current assessments of the operational environment predict urban areas will challenge the ability of U.S. forces to operate cohesively, resupply, communicate, conduct reconnaissance, and achieve surprise.  Densely populated areas with constricting topography and poor infrastructure, will make friendly vehicular and aerial movement more observable and easily disrupted for forces operating from or into these places.    In this week’s professional reading, “Objective Metropolis: the Future of Dense Urban Operational Environments,” authors Jerome J. Lademan and J. Alexander Thew concur with current operational environment assessments and further predict, “cities of tomorrow will present new challenges where titanic populations and infrastructure density will combine with near-instantaneous flow of information to create a leviathan of complexity for the armed forces.” They argue that current Army and Joint doctrine do not address the “unique fabric of crowded urban areas of operation”.  They offer four important challenges that must be considered when developing doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for forces operating in densely populated urban terrain: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Cities’ high-rise structures will challenge the maxim that the “high ground” presents advantageous terrain during military operations. Limited floor space and exfiltration routes may trap a unit by restricting their maneuverability. Units may quickly exhaust the manpower required to “dominate” this terrain by fighting continuously along vertical axes. Success in high-rise buildings might depend on units’ ability to co-opt local expertise.</li>
     <li>At street level, movement through city corridors is severely restricted and completely determined by the relative layout of buildings and roadways. The work of denying “freedom of maneuver” is half achieved by the city itself, before any opposing force is applied. High-rise structures pose similar challenges to air operations, creating an urgent need for manned/unmanned teaming to cover all dead space with observation and direct fires.</li>
      <li>Main weapon systems on most combat vehicles, will not be able to traverse all potential threats. The large number of avenues of approach and potential defensive vantage points will overwhelm even the most skilled target acquisition systems and techniques in current use.</li>
       <li>The expansive subterranean domain provided by immense networks of subway tunnels, working train lines, steam and wastewater pipes, and electrical grid substructures is wholly unique to cities. This network effectively doubles the available routes for a force to move around in, since in many major cities, there are tunnels under every street. Means of communication underground are almost invariably limited to hardline “mine phones,” or a deliberately established system of FM repeaters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lademan and Thew recommend that in developing doctrine and TTP’s, leaders must understand the capabilities and limitations of military action in an urban environment.  They further argue that the joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational nature of city-bound operations requires interagency crosstalk, that active coordination and distribution of mission tasks across the myriad of battlefield players is vital, and critical local knowledge and experience provided by various municipal agents must be incorporated to achieve operational success.  They conclude by recognizing that a the most fundamental level, cities are human domains and that no matter how complex the physical terrain of cities’ infrastructure, the US military must recognize future military objectives in urban areas will be deeply embedded in the context of relationships.  And they emphasize that while the development and ongoing refinement of tactics optimized for dense urban terrain is critical, understanding the intricacies of interactions between the population, host-nation forces, local authorities, US personnel, and other actors is equally as important.</p>
    <p>Lademan and Thew’s article is consistent with the Army Operating Concept (AOC) and the emerging Multi-Domain Battle (MDB) Concept.  The AOC and MDB recognize that urban environments will degrade the ability to target threats with precision. Joint urban operations will require land forces capable of operating in congested and restricted urban terrain (to include subsurface, surface, supersurface) to close with and destroy the enemy.  Perhaps most important, understanding the technological, geographic, political, and military challenges of the urban environment will require innovative, adaptive leaders and cohesive teams who thrive in complex and uncertain environments. Urban operations will require decentralized combined arms and joint capabilities at low levels.  Because future enemies will act to remain indistinguishable from protected populations and infrastructure, combined arms units must possess mobility, protection, and precision firepower to fight for information, overmatch the enemy in close combat, and reduce the risk to non-combatants.  Army forces also need cross-cultural capabilities that permit them to operate effectively among populations.  Finally, Army forces will conduct operations in urban areas consistent with the concept of multi-domain battle – the synchronizing of cross-domain fires and maneuver to achieve physical, temporal, positional, and psychological advantages in order to achieve temporary domain dominance and allow defeat of the enemy across all domains.

</p>
    <p>Lademan and Thew’s article is relevant to the following Army Warfighting Challenges:</p>

      <p>Team,</p>
    <p>Technological advances provided US forces with an asymmetric advantage and contributed significantly to American victories, most notably Operation Desert Storm. The “Big Five” provided ground forces with overwhelming firepower while Global Positioning System navigation provided precision for maneuvering on the battlefield.  Through technological superiority, Army forces can provide national leaders with additional options, capture the initiative rapidly, and create multiple dilemmas for an adversary on the battlefield.  However, technological superiority on its own, does not ensure that US forces will successfully achieve its strategic objectives. While advances in technology will remain vital to the Army, the Army recognizes that there are no "silver bullet" technological solutions.  To retain overmatch, the Army combines and integrates technologies into organizational, doctrinal, leader development, training, and personnel policy changes. </p>
      <p>This week’s Professional Reading is a TED talk by Malcolm Gladwell titled “the Strange Tale of the Norden Bombsight.”  During his Ted Talk, Gladwell examines technology’s impact on warfare by analyzing the Norden bombsight.   Before the development of Global Positioning Systems (GPS), radar, and advanced optics dropping a bomb on a stationary target from a flying aircraft provided a difficult physics problem.  The world recognized the aircraft’s potential but wind, airspeed, altitude, temperature, and other factors complicated bombing efforts until Carl Norden, a Swiss engineer, developed the Mark 15 bombsight – the Norden bombsight.  Before the development of the bombsight, Norden quipped that, “bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more” but, with the Mark 15 pilots “could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft."  </p>
        <p>After spending $1.5 Billion - the Manhattan Project cost $3 Billion – the Norden Bombsight failed to live up to expectations.  Allied efforts to bomb the chemical plant in Leuna, Germany provides an example of the bombsight’s inaccuracy.  After allies flew 22 missions and dropped 85,000 bombs on the 757 acre chemical plant only 10% hit their target.  Gladwell outlines three primary reasons that the Norden Bombsight failed to provide the Allies with a decisive advantage:</p>
          <ul>
          <li> It was difficult to use.</li>
          <li>It broke down a lot.</li>
          <li>It was developed without consideration of wartime conditions. </li>
          </ul>
            <p>Gladwell concludes his TED Talk by observing that “We live in a time where there are all kinds of really, really smart people running around, saying that they've invented gadgets that will forever change our world.”  While new technologies, such as the Norden Bomb sight, may provide some utility, leaders must recognize that complex problems often require complex solutions.  “This is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make,” Gladwell states, “We think the things we make can solve our problems, but our problems are much more complex than that.”  </p>
              <p>As the Army continues to develop the Multi-Domain Battle Concept and looks to industry to provide the capabilities required to execute Multi-Domain Battle in the future, leaders must recognize the limits of emerging technologies.  New problems and new vulnerabilities often accompany the integration of new technologies.  While the Army’s advantage over enemies depends in large measure on advanced technology, the Army will achieve success on the battlefield through skilled leaders and Soldiers that are enabled by technology. As you watch Gladwell’s TED talk on “the Strange Tale of the Norden Bombsight” consider how the Army should apply emerging technologies and the subsequent changes in doctrine, organizations, and training in order to retain combat effectiveness. </p>

         <!--HEADER-->   
      <p>Team,</p>
      <p>In the first of our two article series, last week’s professional reading by Brigadier General (Retired) Rickey Rife examined the character traits, institutional values, and personality preferences of the Department of State and Department of Defense and the challenges of converging political and military capabilities in the pre-9-11 era. In this week’s follow-up article, MAJ Bryan Groves from the Arthur D. Simons Center for Interagency Cooperation, provides an interesting perspective as he explores how differences in risk aversion and resources are the causal factors for the similarities and differences between DoS and DoD. This more contemporary piece reinforces the differences between the two departments but provides us with the opportunity to see each other (DoD & DoS) as value added and as complementary capabilities.  </p>
      <p>MAJ Groves describes the different mission sets for DoD and State by saying DoD concentrates its forces in a few areas during periods of conflict while State maintains a continuous presence in almost every country in the world. In addition to this permanent versus temporary presence contrast, he goes on comparing the two agencies across several other areas including administrative & medical considerations, personnel profiles, culture and physical security, and even the “deployment factor”.  </p>
    <p>This second article highlights the value of complementary operations. DoD and State most effectively exist in a symbiotic world where the DoD capitalizes on the indigenous nature of State. The cultural and political knowhow of state informs military actions and military capability can influence State’s effectiveness. Groves ends his article by stating that the appropriate response when analyzing the differences between organizations is to recognize and appreciate the differences for what they are while also embracing the many similarities: mission focus, competent people, and the desire to contribute to a cause greater than oneself despite real risks.  </p>
    <p>In the context of Multi-Domain Battle (MDB) in future conflicts, we typically start thinking about technological advances and how those will enable us to create windows of overmatch against our enemies and adversaries. There is no doubt these advancements will be critical to our success, but we can’t lose sight of some of the more rudimentary ways to strengthen our capabilities in DoD. Improved relationships and understanding with the DoS will only create more opportunities and increase our ability to influence and shape our battlefield in a non-kinetic way. MAJ Groves’ insights reinforce the need for different agencies and organizations to understand each other and capitalize on our mutually beneficial capabilities, regardless of who we think accepts the most risk. In a future of cost prohibitive technologies and a complicated operating environment, improved coordination amongst agencies and organization is one of the easiest and most cost efficient means for us to improve our position on the battlefield and advance our national interests.   </p>

      <p>Team,</p>
      <p>Responding to crises, addressing the drivers of conflict, and achieving sustainable political outcomes require the application of all elements of national power (diplomatic, information, military, economic, financial, intelligence, and law enforcement). Projecting national power requires military leaders to synchronize and integrate the capabilities and efforts of multiple partners to ensure unity of effort and accomplish missions across the range of military operations. In this first of two weekly readings, Brigadier General (Retired) Rickey Rife writes on the challenges of converging political and military capabilities in the pre-9-11 era.  Next week’s subsequent professional reading by Bryan Groves from the Arthur D. Simons Center for Interagency Cooperation, “Risk Culture, Similarities & Differences between State and DoD”, explores a more contemporary perspective showing these challenges are persistent and still relevant today.</p>
      <p>In this week’s reading, “Defense is from Mars, State is from Venus: Improving Communications and Promoting National Security” then-Lieutenant Colonel, now Brigadier General (Retired) Rickey Rife examines the character traits, institutional values, and personality preferences of the Department of State and Department of Defense.  Rife observes that the relationship between the two agencies is a "marriage of necessity and convenience between two temperamental cultures” based on mutual trust and respect but each organization remains wary of the other.  The scope of foreign policy issues in today's complex world, Rife argues, requires coordination, cooperation, and a higher degree of familiarity with each organization to capitalize on each organization’s inherent strengths.</p>
      <p>Rife points out that the cultures of each organization are as different as alien life from two competing planets.  Although warriors are from Mars (Defense) and diplomats are from Venus (state) each agency must develop a comprehensive understanding and appreciation for one another’s character traits, institutional values, and personality preferences. This understanding requires a cooperative attitude that recognizes the differences and capitalizes on them.</p>
      <p>To increase cooperation Rife proposes “prescriptions” and suggests that “if used as directed” they may lead to a lasting and productive relationship between the two agencies. The following are Rife’s nine proposals:</p>
     <ol>
     <li>A clear line of authority is a “critical first step” towards a productive relationship with the military.</li>
     <li>Expose personnel to the other agency and to differences in their skills and perspectives early in the training cycle -don't wait until stereotypes are already formed.</li>
     <li>Link political-military assignments (broadening tours) to follow-on assignments.</li>
     <li>Ensure promotion boards for state stresses the importance of political-military experience.</li>
     <li>Use military personnel as speakers in State training programs, including the course taken upon entering the Foreign Service.</li>
     <li>Avoid turf battles and parochial interests -reward personnel who make contacts with counterparts in the other agency and return with ideas-e.g. a new technology that may have a broader application.</li>
     <li>Develop exercises and simulations that require personnel from State, the military, and other agencies to work together in developing and implementing policies consistent with Presidential Directives and U.S. policy.</li>
     <li>Educate Congress on how each agency operates.</li>
     <li>Training, training, training.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Rife concludes his essay by observing that organizational cultures will always remain inherently different.  Different is not bad. Recognizing those differences will enable leaders to overcome the biases, prejudices and the stereotypes that limit the ability to work effectively as a team.</p>
     <p>This week’s professional reading highlights the importance of coordination and cooperation with not only the state Department but with all governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and some elements of the private sector.  Army leaders must not only understand how these diverse and disparate organizations operate, but take the necessary steps to increase training opportunities and build and strengthen relationships before combat operations in order to achieve unity of effort during combat operations.</p>
     <p>Multi-Domain Battle (MDB) describes how the convergence of political and military capabilities creates windows of advantage that enables the Joint Force to maneuver or gain a position of advantage. Windows of advantage are when necessary and favorable conditions are achieved over a specified area to prevent its effective use by the enemy or enable friendly operations. Capabilities from other governmental organizations provide the Joint Force commander with additional means and options to deter conflict or open windows of advantage during periods of conflict.  For example, an agency could impose economic costs as a means of preventing conflict or another agency could secure access to dispersed basing locations that enables Joint Forces maneuver during periods of conflict. The most effective means, however, is converging political and military, as well as lethal and non-lethal capabilities across multiple domains in time and space to create windows of advantage that enable the U.S. to gain positions of advantage.</p>

      <p>Team,</p>
      <p>Understanding the operating environment, threats, and technology is important to ensure future Army forces are prepared to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win in future war as part of the Joint Force. Anticipating the demands of future armed conflict not only requires an understanding of the immutable nature of war but also an appreciation of the changes in the character of armed conflict. New technologies and changes that stem from new strategic guidance, revised operating concepts, and emerging security challenges require the Army to stay ahead of change by operating differently and providing the Joint Force with unique capabilities that enable it to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars.</p>
      <p>In this week's professional reading, "The Battle of Convergence in Four Dimensions," an essay originally published in 1992, MAJ Robert Toguchi and James Hogue recognize that advances in technology employed during Operation Desert Storm have potential to improve the operational effectiveness of the future force by expanding operations into "all dimensions."  Toguchi and Hogue argue that these advances will enable forces to converge capabilities to "hit the enemy from all possible approaches" with greater precision, speed, and efficiency. </p>
      <p>Although AirLand Battle enabled US forces to rapidly destroy the Iraqi Army, it focused primarily on two domains.  To maximize the potential of new technology by expanding operations into all domains and converge capabilities, the authors propose a new operational concept: "Battle of Convergence - Four Dimensions" (BOC IV). The objective of BOC IV is to deny enemy freedom of action by dominating all domains and dictating the terms of operations.  To achieve this objective, BOC IV entails the synchronization and maneuver of dispersed air, naval, space, and ground capabilities in time and space. The authors conclude that BOC IV's emphasis on synchronizing and converging capabilities from all domains will improve Joint Force integration and the operational effectiveness of Joint operations. </p>
       <p>This week's professional reading highlights the importance of thinking clearly about the problem of future warfare.  To develop BOC IV, Toguchi and Hogue examined threats, missions, technology, and history.  The authors considered the spectrum of threats and an array of missions in complex, mountainous, and desert terrain that the Joint Force could potentially execute.  Advances in technology enable forces executing BOC IV to achieve greater depth, synchronization, flexibility, and simultaneity but leaders must always recognize that technology has limits and there are no "silver bullet" technological solutions.  Operations and campaigns by General Helmuth von Moltke, Napoleon, and General Eisenhower provided historical insight on the problems and prospects convergence entails.
Ultimately, BOC IV represents a conceptual foundation for the future informed by changes in the character of conflict.
</p>
        <p>To develop a sound conceptual foundation of the future that drives future force development, Army leaders think clearly about future armed conflict;  learn in a focused, sustained, and collaborative manner;  analyze what is learned and then implement solutions to overmatch enemies and adversaries.  Various ARCIC and TRADOC initiatives and efforts enable Army leaders to develop concepts and capabilities that improve future force effectiveness.  For example, the Army's Mission Command Network must enable commanders to develop and maintain situational understanding and maneuver across domains to dispersed locations in order to conduct joint combined arms operations. The Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) is the Army's largest annual operational exercise that integrates, tests, and evaluates network systems and capabilities to enable senior leaders to make informed modernization decisions. The Joint Modernization Command will conduct the next NIE at Fort Bliss, TX 19-31 July 2017.  </p>
         <p>Another important venue is the Mad Scientist program.  Mad Scientist is a TRADOC initiative and a community of action that continually explores the future through collaborative partnerships and continuous dialogue with academia, industry and government. The next Mad Scientist event, 25-26 July 2017, will explore the characteristics of a multi-domain battle in 2050; future roles of Leaders and Soldiers; potential ethical dilemmas created by emerging technologies; disruptive technologies; and dense urban environments, all of which will help inform the development of the Multi-Domain Battle Concept.  Ultimately, NIE and Mad Scientist are but a few of the many TRADOC and ARCIC events that help shape the future Army.</p>
          <p>ARCIC and TRADOC also participate in numerous external events that inform future force development and strengthen collaboration between the Army, and Joint and Multi-National partners.  The Regional Commanders Conference will create a common vision and shared understanding of ways to address U.S. and NATO defense posture and force development concerns to ensure current and future interoperability and readiness to execute Multi-Domain Battle.</p>

      <p>Team,</p>
      
     <p>To ensure that future U.S. Military forces are prepared to prevent conflict, shape the security environment, and win wars, leaders must think clearly about future war; learn about the demands of future armed conflict; analyze what we learn to develop integrated solutions; and implement those solutions to maintain overmatch against increasingly capable enemies.  ADP 1-01 states that concepts are ideas for a significant change based on proposed new approaches to the conduct of operations or technology.  Concepts propose significantly different methods the force might use in the future but change can only occur after a new concept has been assessed, tested, and matured through the use of wargames, experiments, and other learning activities.  Using what is learned, Army leaders are able to analyze, prioritize, and then implement doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facility solutions (DOTMLPF-P).  While learning events are not the only step in future force development, they are critical to drive change.</p>
      <p>In this week’s professional reading, “Revitalizing Wargaming is Necessary to Be Prepared for Future Wars,” Mr. Bob Work, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and General Paul Selva, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, argue that wargaming is more important than ever to navigate today’s complex and dynamic competitive environment impacted by rapid technological change and constrained defense spending.  Successfully navigating this environment will require us to push the boundaries of technology while ensuring that innovation remains rooted in operationally realistic doctrine and capabilities.   Work and Selva further argue that wargames are “not in and of themselves sufficient to prompt organizational and operational change.”   They highlight the need for exercises “to verify game insights using systems at hand or with surrogates that represented desired advanced capabilities identified during game play” and that exercise observations and lessons learned must be fed back into new wargames to create a cycle of creative ideas and innovation in order to generate requirements for new systems, suggested new operation concepts, and influenced force design.</p>
      <p>Work and Selva’s article emphasizes the importance of wargaming and other learning activities to provide insights that prepare leaders for making important decisions that result in changing the Army.  Wargames allow leaders to gain wisdom regarding potential future events, environments, and required future capabilities through interactive experience by igniting and using imagination to expand the realm of possibilities needed to shed light on that which is currently unpredictable, unknown, and unknowable.  Lastly, wargames allow for failure and the ability to explore, reflect, and move beyond our own experiences.  As the authors observe, “wargaming is important because it allows participants to fail, fail again, experience the loss, adapt, innovate, and then get it right.”</p>
       <p>Wargames are an important part of the Army’s Campaign of Learning: Force 2025 Maneuvers.  Force 2025 Maneuvers are the physical (experimentation, evaluations, exercises, modeling, simulations, and wargames) and intellectual (studies, analysis, and capabilities development) activities that help leaders integrate future capabilities and develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges.  Through wargaming and other Force 2025 Maneuvers events, leaders gather insight that enables them to define capability gaps, identify opportunities to achieve overmatch, and develop solutions (DOTMLPF-P) for near, mid, and far terms. The most effective wargames are those that create an environment characterized by “fog” and “friction” where incomplete and imperfect knowledge prevails.  Such environments force Army leaders to apply critical reasoning and diagnose the characteristics of competition.</p>
       <p>Unified Quest (UQ) is the Army Chief of Staff's Title 10 future study plan designed to explore enduring strategic and operational challenges to identify issues and explore solutions critical to current and future development. UQ helps leaders understand potential future missions and how to achieve those missions in future operating environments against future enemies.  UQ is designed for cumulative learning in a series of wargames, seminars, and analytical studies that help leaders identify the capabilities our Army must possess in the future by assessing the projected force mix, force design, and Total Army capacity required for future Army forces to accomplish missions as part of the Joint Force.  How The Army Fights (HTAF) is another important wargame that informs concept and capability development.  During HTAF leaders gather to determine requirements to deter the escalation of violence, defeat threat operations, turn denied spaces into contested spaces should violence escalate, and maneuver forces from contested strategic and operational depth.  The next HTAF will occur in early August.   UQ and HTAF play an important role in helping the Army think, learn, and analyze important ideas underlying the development of Multi-Domain Battle in the coming years.</p>
       <p>Insights from wargames enable Army leaders to identify the implications to DOTMLPF solutions and determine what capabilities the Army should pursue in order to win on future battlefields.   Insights from UQ will be presented to senior leaders in July when they will gather to discuss the trends, implications, and resulting recommendations.  The trends, implications, and recommendations will not only help shape the development of the Multi-Domain Battle concept but also inform near-term strategic decisions, such as the prioritization of future capabilities in the Strategic Portfolio Analysis Review (SPAR).</p>

    <p>On 22 June ARCIC will host Dr. Michael Auslin, the author of this week's essay, as part of its Distinguished Speaker Series.
    Dr. Auslin will discuss US Strategy at the End of the Asian Century and provide his thoughts on ways the US can address the increasing risk from a region that, in his view, is deeply fractured and threatened by economic stagnation and political upheaval.  The event is open to all who wish to attend.  Information on Dr. Auslin and his upcoming visit to ARCIC and Fort Eustis can be viewed <a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/Event?Group=DSS">here</a>: 
    </p>
    
      <p>Team,</p>
      
      <p>Since the Empress of China departed New York harbor and sailed to Macau in 1784, the US recognized the significance of the Asia-Pacific region to its security and economic prosperity.  Over the past three decades observers predict that the growing economies, increasing influence, and military strength of Asia-Pacific nations will shift global power from the West to the East resulting in an "Asian Century" of unparalleled Asian power and prosperity.  These observers believe that the East is replacing the West and the shift of global power will permanently reshape the world. </p>
      <p>The rapid growth, expanding populations, and increasing military strength that has occurred in the Asia-Pacific over the last three decades may lend credence to their predictions.  Admiral Harry Harris observed that the Asia-Pacific now includes three of the world’s largest economies while Asia-Pacific nations produce 40% of the world's exports and are central to everything from weaving textiles to crafting the most advanced electronic technologies.  In the South China Sea alone, approximately $5.3 trillion in annual global trade flows through its sea lanes while 25% of global oil shipments and nearly 50% of all natural gas transits the Strait of Malacca each day.  Today, over four billion people call the Asia-Pacific home and one in every three people on our planet is either Chinese or Indian.   The Asia-Pacific also includes seven of the most powerful militaries in the world, six nuclear armed states, and the only nation to test a nuclear weapon during this century.  </p>
      <p>A dynamic and peaceful appearance on the surface does not always account for unseen threats that have potential to riddle the Asian continent.  In this week's professional reading, The End of the Asian Century, which is an excerpt from his book “The End of the Asian Century: War, Stagnation, and the Risks to the World’s Most Dynamic Region," Dr. Michael Auslin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, contends that the world has myopically focused on Asia’s successes and ignored many of the warning signs that indicate Asia is a fractured region threatened by stagnation and instability.  Dr. Auslin argues that instead of a century of unparalleled Asian power and prosperity, we are actually seeing the end of the “Asian Century.”  Dr. Auslin reaches this conclusion by examining five interrelated areas that explore the economic, military, political, and demographic factors that threaten Asia’s future and increase the risk of war or widespread economic collapse.  </p>
      <p>Dr. Auslin explores the following areas:  failure of economic reform, demographic pressure, unfinished political revolutions, the lack of a regional political community, and the threat of war.  Arrayed in the conceptual framework of a “risk map,” Auslin identifies the most important trends in the region and assesses their risk and notes, “if we wish to avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of a war in Asia or a widespread economic collapse, we need to understand the diversity of risks the region faces and to begin thinking about how to manage those risks."  Based on these risks, Dr. Auslin suggests that “the “Asian Century” may not turn out to be an era when Asia imposes a peaceful order on the world, when freedom continues to expand, or when the region remains the engine of global economic growth.  Instead, what it may impose on the world is more conflict and instability.  </p>
      <p>One of our most important duties as Army professionals is to think clearly about the problem of future armed conflict.  That is because our vision of the future must drive change to ensure that Army forces are prepared to prevent conflict, shape the security environment, and win wars.  Leaders think ahead in time to anticipate opportunities and dangers and take prudent risk to gain and maintain positions of relative advantage over the enemy.  Thinking clearly about future armed conflict requires consideration of threats, enemies, and adversaries; anticipated missions, emerging technologies, opportunities to use existing capabilities in new ways, and historical observations and lessons learned.  Army leaders develop concepts aligned with each warfighting function (mission command, intelligence, movement and maneuver, fires, engagement, maneuver support and protection, and sustainment) to identify, through experimentation and learning activities, what capabilities are required for the future force to accomplish missions across the range of military operations. </p>
      <p>Dr. Auslin offers important insights into how to think about the threats and dangers that have potential to emanate from the Asia-Pacific region.  His insights offer important considerations as we think, learn and develop the Multi-Domain Battle concept.  On 24 May 2017 at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Land Forces Pacific (LANPAC) Symposium, Admiral Harry Harris, the PACOM Commander, indicated that the Asia-Pacific Theater is "a complex environment where our joint and combined forces are operating in each other’s domains."  Considering many of the threats that Dr. Auslin observes, Multi-Domain Battle will be critical to ensure access to the global commons and fight in those same commons should war come. </p>
      <p>USARPAC, in collaboration with TRADOC, is developing insights for the Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF).  The MDTF will pave the way for the U.S. Army to support Counter-Anti-Access/Area Denial challenges in order to transition denied space into contested space.  The MDTF will prove to be an essential tool that proactively counters our adversaries’ attempts to fracture, deny, and fix U.S. military strengths.  Designed, developed, and resourced to protect friendly forces and critical nodes, the MDTF can potentially possess long range kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities to strike critical enemy assets.  In addition to executing these missions and serving in support of the Joint Task Force Commander’s strategic objectives, the MDTF must integrate organic and joint capabilities to ensure Joint Force freedom of action.  In the near-future, the Army will initiate a pilot program to test the MDTF.  Noting that U.S. military power is Joint power and the importance of cross-service collaboration to develop the concept and the MDTF, Admiral Harris recently remarked, "Our Nation depends on us – the big "Us" to get this right."  </p>

    <p>“… Seven thousand miles away the Arabs attacked Israel in October 1973.  Within a few weeks, General Abrams dispatched me and BG Bob Baer to Israel.  There, Bob and I walked battlefields with the IDF Commanders who had fought on them, seeking answers to many questions about the future U.S. Army. … Answers to those questions framed the beginning of what grew into, some nine years later, the doctrine called AirLand Battle, a concept of war at the tactical and operational levels that the U.S. and coalition commanders employed in Operation Desert Storm.”  </p>

    </blockquote>
      <p>Team,</p>
      <p>The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command’s capstone international engagement is the Future Battlefield Annual Talks (FBAT), held each year with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). This important learning event has roots in TRADOC’s earliest interactions with the IDF Ground Forces following the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Those engagements, and study of the war led by GEN Donn Starry, contributed to development of the U.S. Army’s AirLand Battle Doctrine and the “Big 5”.  
FBAT remains the most significant and comprehensive U.S. Army bilateral engagement with the IDF. Led by CG, TRADOC and the Commander of the IDF Ground Forces, FBAT brings together Center of Excellence (CoE) Commanders, branch school commandants and their Israeli counterparts to explore a wide range of issues relevant to Army Warfighting Challenges, emerging concepts, capabilities development, science and technology, and R&D.  TRADOC will host the 26th FBAT at our centers of excellence and Fort Eustis from 4-8 June 2017.  The plenary session will focus on Multi-Domain Battle, with emphasis on the cyber domain, Russia New Generation Warfare, and the network.  
</p>
      <p>This week’s professional reading is an excerpt from Volume 1 of “Press On, Selected Works of General Donn A. Starry” to highlight how thinking and learning about future armed conflict requires careful consideration of threats, enemies, and adversaries, anticipated missions, emerging technologies, and historical observations and lessons learned. Those considerations are sometimes derived from studying the outcomes of battles fought by our allies and partners.  </p>
      <p>In GEN Starry’s “Reflections on TRADOC’s Analysis of the Yom Kippur War, The Jaffee Center Military Doctrine Joint Conference, Israel, 16 March 1999”, he describes the convergence of events that helped to reshape the U.S. Army following the Vietnam War.  There was a lack of attention paid to major combat during the 1960s when the U.S. Army’s focus was firmly on the war in Southeast Asia.  Meanwhile, the defense of Western Europe from the many armored and mechanized divisions of the Warsaw Pact was another problem altogether with the diversion of resources for operations in Vietnam.  When the U.S. Army finally disengaged from that protracted fight, it became clear that its Cold War adversary, the Soviet Army, had modernized. It was equally clear that major changes were needed within the U.S. Army.  In October 1972, GEN Creighton Abrams was appointed Chief of Staff and embarked on the mission to rehabilitate his Service for the post-Vietnam era.  A significant milestone in this effort was the stand-up of TRADOC on 1 July 1973. </p>
      <p>Just three months later, on 6 October 1973, the Yom Kippur War began when an Arab coalition launched a joint surprise attack on Israeli positions in the occupied territories of the Sinai and Golan Heights.  Although it was not the Soviets themselves, but their equipment and tactics employed by Syrian and Egyptian allies, the lessons were clear.  According to GEN Starry in a speech to the TRADOC Historians Conference on 17 January 1989, “soon laid out for all to see were lessons of the Yom Kippur War:  the staggering density of the battlefield at critical points; the presence on both sides of large numbers of modern weapon systems; the increased criticality of command and control; the increased likelihood of interrupted command and control due to large numbers of sophisticated electronic warfare means; the inability of any single weapon system to prevail, reaffirming the essentiality of all arms combat; the outcome of battle reflecting, more often than not, factors other than numbers”.  In a Letter to Cadet Marty D’Amato dated 10 April 1998, entitled “AirLand Battle Determinants”, GEN Starry goes on to say, “the Israeli influence on AirLand Battle can scarcely be ignored.  For it was their open and generous sharing of IDF lessons from the Yom Kippur War against Soviet-style echeloned formations that vividly demonstrated what we had to do.”</p>
      <p>We can draw parallels to the early days of TRADOC.  In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in April 2016, LTG McMaster’s statement hearkened to the early 1970s when he said, “It is clear that while our Army was engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq, Russia studied U.S. capabilities and vulnerabilities and embarked on an ambitious and largely successful modernization effort”.  Now, as the U.S. Army addresses lessons from Russia’s New Generation Warfare and begins to explore its next warfighting concept, Multi-Domain Battle, and the capabilities required to execute it, TRADOC continues to illustrate that it’s a learning organization that drives change in the U.S. Army.  </p>

			<p>Team</p>	 
      <p>The U.S. military can no longer assume continuous superiority in any domain as potential adversaries can now disrupt the effectiveness or deny the use of U.S. combat capabilities. Increasingly complex air, land, sea, space, and cyber capabilities allow adversaries to contest U.S. force dominance and diminish our comparative advantage. This situation is exacerbated by the optimization of ground and air forces towards counterinsurgency operations that further reduces the ability of the Joint Force to counter sophisticated threats. In contrast to counterinsurgency operations, future U.S. forces will likely confront the sensor-rich militaries of peer states that employ both massed and precision-guided munitions across the depth and breadth of highly lethal battlefields. U.S. forces must anticipate being contested in all domains across a vastly extended area of operations by enemies that possess systems that match or exceed existing U.S. ground combat capabilities. To overcome these challenges, the Army must develop new capabilities while anticipating enemy efforts to emulate or disrupt those capabilities. And to retain overmatch, the Joint Force will have to combine technologies and integrate efforts across multiple domains to present enemies with multiple dilemmas.</p>
       <p>In this week’s professional reading, “Some New, Some Old, All Necessary:  The Multi-Domain Imperative,” William Dries expands on the need to combine technologies and integrate efforts across multiple domains. He argues that to win in future war the Joint Force “needs more than just having and using capabilities across the five domains. It needs the ability to integrate planning and conduct operations with capabilities from all domains regardless of which service, component, or level of command they come from.” Dries further emphasizes that the required solution to this problem is not revolutionary, but rather, that “multi-domain operations are another form of jointness, but far more advanced and profoundly different than the kind of jointness the U.S. military has been accustomed to since the Goldwater-Nichols Act.” He implies that a Multi-Domain Battle concept is more than each service developing an operational concept to describe its specific role within its currently associated domain. He argues that the ideas for Multi-Domain Battle must become “ingrained in U.S. military culture across the services.” However, he warns, this comes at a cost because services are understandably reluctant to trade proficiency in their core competencies for futuristic-sounding but potentially empty promises of multi-domain prowess. The goal, he says, “can only be accomplished by working continuously with the other services, creating habitual relationships between tactical units, and training according to a “multi-domain, all the time” mindset.”  </p>
        <p>Dries’ essay is consistent with many of the ideas in the current U.S. Army-Marine Corps White paper entitled “Multi-Domain Battle: Combined Arms for the 21st Century.” The white paper describes a coordinated Army and Marine Corps approach for ground combat operations against a sophisticated peer enemy threat in the 2025-2040 timeframe. Further, it promotes thought and discussion concerning the methods and capabilities required to confront sophisticated threats. The paper offers specific hypotheses to inform concept development, wargaming, experimentation, and capability development. Building on current service and joint doctrine, “Multi-Domain Battle: Combined Arms for the 21st Century” evolves the combined arms methodology to include not only those capabilities of the physical domains, but also those of abstract domains such as cyberspace, the EMS, the information environment, and the cognitive dimension of warfare. While this paper encompasses the views of the U.S. Army-Marine Corps, it is developed as an endeavor that must include the entire Joint Force. Therefore, the expectation is that the ideas within the white paper will, in concert with the other Services, be refined and expanded into appropriate joint concepts and service concepts. </p>

		  <p>Acting Director Major General Robert “Bo” Dyess’ Comments:</p>	
			<p>Team</p>	 
      <p>The 2015 Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy (CVMS) stresses that vehicle modernization efforts must solve the “combat vehicle challenge;” that is, designing combat vehicles that protect Soldiers against threats and deliver precision lethality while providing both tactical mobility and global responsiveness within the limitations of vehicle cost and weight. The Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) is capable of moving mounted to positions of advantage rapidly and fighting dismounted to defeat enemy forces. The SBCT, however, faces challenges as potential adversaries improve the range and lethality of their capabilities.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of its annexation of Crimea in March 2014, Russian forces began supporting separatists in Eastern Ukraine with advanced weaponry. This ongoing conflict offers important insights about the lethality of the modern battlefield. The U.S. Army has not faced this level of lethality, particularly in Europe, since World War II. As General Daniel Allyn, Vice Chief of Staff of Army, stated during his most recent testimony, the Army could find itself “outgunned, outranged, and outdated.” The Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV), the primary maneuver vehicle in the SBCT, lacks the sensors and weapons to detect, recognize, identify and suppress or defeat threats at extended ranges or provide fire support for infantry as they dismount in close proximity to the enemy. The lack of sufficient mobile protected direct fire support throughout the formation makes it difficult to maintain freedom of movement and action, and makes the formation’s Soldiers vulnerable to surprise encounters with the enemy. Moreover, force protection improvements to protect the Stryker from IEDs and RPGs in Iraq and Afghanistan have significantly reduced the vehicle’s tactical mobility. Continued modernization of the SBCT is required to maintain overmatch. </p>
	<p>In this week’s article, “Lethality Upgrade: Why a New Stryker Variant is needed on the Modern Battlefield,” Captain Andrew Gregory highlights the importance of the current upgrades to Stryker’s lethality. Of importance is Gregory’s implication that any modernization recommendations and solutions, specifically with respect to increased firepower, must be considered across DOTMLPF to collectively produce the force capabilities and attributes desired. He states, “Considering the number of BCTs under the current proposed force, the proliferation of armor and anti-armor threats, and the shift in understanding since the SBCT’s conception, turning down lethality upgrades to the formation is unwise.” He further emphasizes that critics ignore the supporting DOTMLPF solutions that would accompany increasing range and lethality of the Stryker’s weapon systems. “An increase in lethality for the SBCT,” he says, “would necessarily lead to an update to the formation’s doctrine and training techniques.” Gregory concludes that embracing the lethality upgrade and its supporting DOTMLPF solutions as part of a continued “evolution of a robust SBCT concept points toward an Army better prepared for future conflict.”  </p>
  <p>This week’s reading reminds us that a modern combat vehicle fleet is recognized worldwide as the hallmark of a capable, credible Army. As such, combat vehicle modernization is necessary to address and counter existing and projected capability gaps. Lethality improvements to the Stryker not only makes the platform more lethal, but provides the SBCT Commander more options to maneuver through contested terrain against future enemies. And that modernization is more than just the weapon system. Modernization requires identifying, assessing, and documenting changes across DOTMLPF that collectively produce the force capabilities and attributes prescribed in approved concepts, concept of operations, or other authoritative sources.  </p>
  <p>As our legacy platforms – M1 Abrams and M2 Bradley – near the fifty-year mark of service and begin to display the limitations of Twentieth Century platforms operating in the Twenty-First Century, Army leaders must determine the necessary balance between modernization and development and identify inflection points that demand decisions for future capabilities. Captain Gregory’s essay and the Stryker lethality upgrade process provides a model of how best to identify emerging critical capability gaps and then rapidly collaborate with industry to provide solutions that ensure future Soldiers and Joint teams can fight, win, and survive on tomorrow’s battlefields. </p>

			<p>Team</p>	      
      <p>During his 27 April 2017 testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Admiral Harry Harris Jr., Commander, U.S. Pacific Command, stated, “America’s future security and economic prosperity are indelibly linked to the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, which is now at a strategic crossroads where real opportunities meet real challenges.” Since World War II, the United States has continued to support the advancement of security, development, and democracy in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. Maintaining security and stability is not a simple task in a region containing thirty-six countries in sixteen time zones, more than half the world’s population, and covering more than half the world’s surface area. </p>
      <p>While primarily a peaceful region for more than 70 years, the current security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific is threatened by a range of state and non-state actors who are challenging the rules-based security order that helped maintain peace and prosperity since World War II. North Korea remains dangerous and unpredictable while China’s armed forces continue to pursue a long-term, comprehensive modernization program designed to improve their capacity to fight and win short-duration, high-intensity regional conflicts. China is also projecting power into the South China Sea through large-scale land reclamation and the militarization of these features. Additionally, the proliferation of advanced anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) capabilities in the region provide an additional security challenge.  These security challenges are not necessarily new but will not be solved by "business as usual."   To develop solutions to these challenges requires a greater degree of Joint integration that begins with a multi-domain perspective. As General Brown states in this week's essay, “integration requires a new approach, a new mind-set."  </p>
      <p>This week’s professional reading “The Indo-Asia-Pacific and the Multi-Domain Battle Concept” by General Robert Brown, Commander, U.S. Army Pacific Command, highlights how the emerging concept of Multi-Domain Battle addresses the increasing complexity of the battlefield and its requirement for Joint integration. While acknowledging that Multi-Domain Battle may initially appear to be traditional joint operations; GEN Brown argues that all services must better integrate planning, operations, command and control, and effects across all the domains. The Army can no longer focus solely on the land, leaving the air and sea to other services. Brown adds that the Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard cannot focus only on “their” domains. Through improved integration Multi-Domain Battle will enable the Joint Force to overcome denial technologies and jointly affect all domains to create localized areas of overmatch. These effects will then re-enable maneuver for the entire joint force operating in any region, thereby placing an enemy in a position of disadvantage so U.S. forces can gain the initiative.  </p>
      <p>General Brown highlights three elements of Multi-Domain Battle that will help define its desired effects: joint integration, technology, and people.</p>
   
<p>- Joint Integration: The Multi-Domain Battle concept is expected to integrate three key areas: organizations and processes, technology, and people. Changes in organizations and processes will be designed to provide different and better-focused Army tools to joint forces to overcome the United States’ loss of superiority or parity in certain domains, particularly in the air, at sea, and within cyberspace. </p>
<p>- Technology: Technology offers key tools to support decision making, lethality, and protection. Multi-Domain Battle must incorporate this technology to empower service members and increase their lethality and effectiveness. </p>
<p>- People: The U.S. Armed Forces must use its people to overcome the challenges of being outnumbered, outdistanced, and “outlearned” by adversaries.  The services must develop agile and adaptive leaders through education and training.</p>

      <p>US Army Pacific is applying the joint integration, technology, and people aspects of the Multi-Domain Battle concept through rigorous inclusion of concepts and capabilities in all its exercises.  This effort will culminate in a major test at the Navy’s Rim of the Pacific exercise in 2018. Moreover, US Army Pacific is considering how to integrate a multi-domain approach with their planning, equipping, and leader-development efforts.  </p>
      <p>GEN Brown's article underscores the importance of Multi-Domain Battle to improve Joint integration. Army forces enable Joint force freedom of action through cross-domain fires and maneuver, extending mutual support across long distances, and projecting power from land into the other domains to overcome A2/AD challenges. Maneuvering ground forces with cross-domain capabilities into positions of advantage denies an adversary their freedom of movement and action by turning denied areas into contested areas and serves as a deterrent and enabler for other joint operations.  Multi-Domain Battle evolves combined arms methodology to include not only those capabilities of the physical domains, but also greater emphasis on space, cyberspace, and other contested areas such as the EMS, the information environment, and the cognitive dimension of warfare.</p>
      <p>Multi-Domain Battle will be a featured topic at the 2017 LANPAC symposium, held 23-25 May in Hawaii.  During the event GEN Perkins will participate in a panel to address the role of the US Army in the Pacific through the lens of Multi-Domain Battle.  Such events are important to the development of the Multi-Domain Battle concept to promote thought and discussion concerning the methods and capabilities required to address the changing character of conflict.  The TRADOC Multi-Domain Battle website is another means to promote discussion and contribute ideas.  <a href="http://www.tradoc.army.mil/MultiDomainBattle/index.asp" target="_blank">The Multi-Domain Battle website can be reached here. <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>  </p>
      <p>Additionally, on 22 June ARCIC will host Dr. Michael Auslin, of the American Enterprise Institute, as part of the distinguished speaker series to share his insights on the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region.

<p>
Innovation is critical for both the operational and institutional Army to ensure that our Soldiers, leaders, and teams are prepared to win in future armed conflict. Innovation challenges us to anticipate changing conditions to ensure that Army forces are manned, trained and equipped to overmatch enemies in order to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. Additionally, innovation drives the development of new tools or methods that permit Army forces to anticipate future demands and stay ahead of determined enemies. In their conclusion to the book, The Dynamics of Military Revolution: 1300-2050, Williamson Murray and McGregor Knox identified the following four characteristics of successful military innovation:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Innovation does not come from technology alone.</li>
    <li>Innovation emerges from evolutionary problem-solving directed at specific operational and tactical issues.</li>
    <li>Innovation requires coherent frameworks of doctrine and concepts.</li>
    <li>Innovation must be rooted in and limited by strategic givens and continuities in the nature of war. </li>

    </ol>
     <p>While not the sole factor in military innovation, integrating emerging technologies and using old technologies in new ways is essential for improving future force combat effectiveness. Because of the ease with which many technological advantages are copied or countered, the Army must pursue multiple technological improvements and anticipate enemy efforts to emulate or disrupt new capabilities.</p>
      <p>In this week's professional reading, "What the Past Teaches about the Future," Max Boot asserts that while the U.S. has been dominant in the information age, there is "no guarantee that its streak will continue." He offers that history provides many examples where superpowers failed to take advantage of important technological advancements and suffered sudden, unexpected defeats. He warns, "The longer you are on top, the more natural it seems, and the less thinkable it is that anyone will displace you." He concludes, "Complacency can seep in, especially if, as with the United States, you enjoy power without peer of precedent."</p>
       <p>To maintain overmatch against future competitors requires continuous innovation, however, Boot argues that history does not offer a blueprint of how military innovation occurs, as "there is no single model that covers all cases." He suggests that the way to gain military advantage and retain overmatch is not necessarily to be the first to produce a new tool or weapon-it is how to utilize and integrate a widely available tool into all formations. "Innovation must be organizational as much as technological, and it needs to focus on potential threats across the entire spectrum, from low-intensity guerilla wars to high-intensity conventional conflicts."</p>
        <p>This week's professional reading reminds us that as new military technologies are more easily transferred, potential threats emulate U.S. military capabilities to counter U.S. power projection and limit U.S. freedom of action. To maintain overmatch in the future operating environment, the Army must continue to innovate by turning ideas into valued outcomes faster than determined and adaptive adversaries. Most importantly, successful innovation requires focused and sustained collaboration among DOD, national research and development communities, industry, academia, and international partners to drive capability development and deliver DOTMLPF-P solutions that permit future forces to defeat determined enemies and accomplish the mission.</p>

			<p>Team</p>	
      <p>
      For centuries military strategists and practitioners understood that a fundamental conception of war was necessary to inform military thinking to prepare for future conflicts.  An examination of the history shows many examples of leaders who understood this necessity.  For example, in 1864, Prussia and Austria-Hungary went to war with Denmark over the duchy of Schleswig-Holstein.  Unlike previous European conflicts, the war with Denmark was conducted within a conceptual framework created by the Prussian Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck.  Helmut von Moltke led the Prussians to victory against Danish forces that were ensconced in an earlier conception of war, one rooted in early nineteenth century.  Following Operation Desert Storm, the U.S. military attributed much of its success to the efficacy of the AirLand Battle concept.  This week’s reading underscores the importance of concepts in thinking about the problem of future war and providing a method for militaries to grow and solidify their understanding of what future combat may look like.  This can often be the difference between success and failure on the battlefield.  As General Donn Starry stated in his Commander’s Note #3, 20 Feb 1979: “A concept is an idea, a thought, a general notion.  In its broadest sense a concept describes what is to be done; in its more specific sense it can be used to describe how something is done.”  Concepts provide the intellectual foundation and framework for future force development.   
      </p>
      
      <p>
      In his 2001 essay, “That Elusive Operational Concept,” Brigadier General (Retired) David Fastabend, former ARCIC Concept Development and Learning Directorate Director, analyzes concept development.  Fastabend’s argues that concepts have common characteristics.  Characteristics that concepts should possess:  
      </p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>1) An idealization of war.  The operational concept is an image of combat: a concise visualization that portrays the strategic requirement, the adversary and his capabilities, and the scenario by which that adversary will be overcome to accomplish the strategic requirement.</li>
      <li>2) A reflection of strategic context. Operational concepts vary between nations and over time because they must reflect the wide range of strategic environments for those who would employ them.	</li>
      <li>3) A link among theory, strategic context and doctrine.  The operational concept filters theory through the lens of geopolitical circumstances, national culture, historical context and technology to frame a doctrine of war—the codification of practice.</li>
      <li>4) A choice.  An operational concept comprises a fundamental choice: a clear decision that selects among an array of potential approaches, the preferred technique for success.</li>
      <li>5) A component of conflict.  Operational concepts are essential components of conflict because they compete with those of our adversaries.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>To develop a clear articulation of how the future Army will fight, Fastabend stressed the importance of overcoming challenges to concept development:</p>
     <ul class="list-unstyled">
     <li>     1)  Ideas Matter.  The operational concept is fundamentally an idea, and ideas matter.  A list of concepts is not an image of future combat; they offer no real choice.
</li>
      <li>	2)  Debate Matters.  Because ideas matter, good ideas create good debate. Without debate good ideas may fail.
</li>
       <li>	3)   Clarity matters. Debates matter, but they are not possible if the disputed ideas lack clarity. Concepts that are recognizable only through the lens of historical retrospect lack utility.  It is not enough if the composite elements of an effective operational concept are unrecognizably buried in doctrine.
</li>
        <li>	4)  Resources matter. The common thread that links the history of concepts is resources. Once developed, concepts must be fielded and embedded in the force. Concepts require widespread understanding; they cannot be put together on the fly.
</li>
         <li>	5) Leaders matter. Concepts need leaders who recognize ideas that matter, refine those ideas through effective debate, distill them with clarity, and bring resources to their implementation.
If the Army does not offer a simple, clear depiction of how it will fight in the future, development efforts will result in a concept that is easy to sell but impossible to execute. 
</li>
     </ul>
     <p>The Army modernizes and develops the future Army using the Think-Learn-Analyze-Implement paradigm.  While doctrine explains how current Army forces operate and guides leaders and Soldiers in the conduct of training and operations, concepts describe how commanders might employ future capabilities against anticipated threats to accomplish missions. Concepts are the result of Army leaders thinking about the problem of future warfare to illustrate how future joint and Army forces may operate, describe the capabilities required to carry out the range of military operations against adversaries in the expected operational environment, and explain how a commander might employ these capabilities to achieve desired effects and objectives. Concept development is informed by known shortfalls; technology, threats, technologies, missions, and lessons learned from previous operations, experimentation, and research. The absence of a well-developed concept has potential to adversely affect the Army’s ability to innovate, resource, and prepare for the future.  </p>
     <p>As the Army develops the Multi-Domain Battle concept leaders must be mindful that the concept requires broad debate and the expression of new ideas and the consideration of old ideas used in new ways.   Leaders must consider when and who will debate the ideas and ensure the debates do not turn into parochial arguments.  Leaders must strive for clarity and simplicity while capturing the complexity of war.  Leaders must refine concepts through experimentation and testing to validate ideas in realistic and challenging.  Leaders must ensure concepts allow for a grounded projection into the future to ensure we can meet today’s and tomorrow’s challenges.    Lastly, leaders must remember that concept development is not completed overnight.  The development of AirLand Battle was years in the making.  Given that DOTMLPF solutions are derived from concepts the Army doesn't have to get it completely right but it does have to be more right than our enemies.  </p>

		  <p>Acting Director Major General Robert “Bo” Dyess’ Comments:</p>		
			<p>Team</p>	
      <p>In the future operating environment, state and non-state threats, enemies, and adversaries will attempt to disrupt what they perceive as U.S. advantages across all domains (i.e. land, maritime, aerospace, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum). While long-range strike and offshore capabilities remain important to joint force operations, the integration and application of combined arms is integral to the execution of Joint Combined Arms Maneuver. Joint Combined Arms Maneuver is the synchronized, simultaneous, or sequential application of two or more arms or elements of one service, along with joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to create multiple dilemmas for the enemy and allow the Joint Force Commander to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. Only by leveraging different capabilities from across the range of forces, can a commander truly present an enemy with multiple dilemmas while gaining and maintaining freedom of action. </p>   
      <p>In “Grant’s Disengagement from Cold Harbor,” Gordon Rhea briefly outlines the nature of the fighting at Cold Harbor that left the contesting armies at less than 100 yards apart. Torrential rivers and boggy marshes precluded rapid movement of formations across parts of the battlefield. The ability of Union Commander General Ulysses S. Grant’s to maneuver against Confederate General Robert E. Lee was restricted on June 3, 1864 as Grant’s multi-corps assault failed to penetrate Lee’s entrenched defenses resulting in over 5,500 casualties. Restrictive maneuver presented Grant with an operational dilemma of how to unhinge Lee’s firmly ensconced forces. In his memoirs, Grant noted that because “Lee’s position was so near Richmond…and the intervening swamps of the Chickahominy so great an obstacle to the movement of troops in the face of an enemy that I determined to make my next left flank move carry the Army of the Potomac south of the James River.”  </p>
      <p>Unable to force the Union Army through Lee’s position, Grant sought to reposition his force between the Confederates and Richmond and apply the full range of combined arms to his operational problem. Union cavalry executed reconnaissance and security operations to screen maneuver and provide guard operations against potential enemy counterattack. Union engineers employed all available bridging and pontoon assets in theater to cross the Chickahominy and James Rivers. The crossing of the James was successful only through the integration of Union Naval transportation, firepower and logistics. Synchronized Union artillery fires and smoke provided the cover and concealment against Confederate forces, allowing Union ground forces to maneuver successfully to secured positions. Under Grant’s leadership, the Union Army achieved integrated joint effects enabling Union forces to attain secured positions while presenting Lee and the Confederate Army with new dilemmas. </p>
      <p>This week’s professional reading reminds us that the Army’s ability to close with and destroy enemy forces through fire and maneuver is essential to ensure joint force freedom of action. In the coming days, the Capabilities Development and Integration Directorates (CDIDs) from the Army’s Centers of Excellence will consider the same operational problem that Grant faced after Cold Harbor: how to regain freedom of action and maneuver facing an adversary that limits your offensive capabilities. Much as Grant, our Army will have to rely on a multi-domain approach to confront the challenges in the operating environment of the future. This will require the full spectrum of combined arms, integrating reconnaissance and security formations, offensive and defensive fires, and maneuver support capabilities to counter adversaries that increasingly exhibit parity within their capabilities and whose anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) systems will limit the full application of joint enablers. </p>
      <p>While some of our discussions will focus on familiar capabilities—obscuration, fires, and vertical lift—we will also examine how best to integrate 21st Century logistics technologies into our formations to ensure unimpeded sustainment flows across the land, air, and maritime domains. We require 21st Century technologies to enable increased efficiency and reduced demand through lower fuel consumption, decreased waste generation, efficient storage, power and energy generation, and timely and agile logistics and precision resupply. The Army is also developing technologies to enable automated and autonomous ground and air resupply. These technologies seek to minimize the logistical footprint, reduce risk to Soldiers, and preserve freedom of maneuver and action. </p>

		  <p>Acting Director Major General Robert “Bo” Dyess’ Comments:</p>		
			<p>Team</p>	 
      <p>One hundred years ago this week, on April 6, 1917, the United States Congress voted to formally enter World War I.  As with most wars, WWI would prove to be fertile ground for accelerated innovation.  This innovation accelerated through numerous series of actions, reactions, and counter-actions as adversaries rushed to gain and regain the overmatch necessary to maintain differential advantages against one another.  In this rush, WWI would showcase developments that included machine guns, tanks, tactical air support, poison gas, flame throwers, tracer bullets, depth charges, and aircraft carriers.  WWI would also see the introduction of the first unmanned aerial system (UAS).  The Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane, developed by the U.S. Navy in 1916 and 1917, was originally designed as an unmanned aerial bomb.  It proved at the time, however, too imprecise to be useful against ships during the war (1).  </p>
        <p>
      <figure class="figure small">     
        <img src="../App_Imgs/Content/LPD138_02f.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">
        (Caption) The Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane was a project undertaken during World War I to develop an aerial torpedo, also called a flying bomb or pilotless aircraft, capable of carrying explosives to its target.  Its first flew in September of 1917. 
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      </p>
      <p>One hundred years later, the weaponization of UAS is front page news.  As the Army Operating Concept (AOC) warns, potential enemies will continue to invest in technologies to obtain a differential advantage and undermine U.S. ability to achieve overmatch and unmanned aerial systems are one of these technologies.  A recent Washington Post article highlighted the Islamic State’s use of weaponized UAS, more commonly referred to as drones.  The article states that “two years after the Islamic State first used commercially purchased drones to conduct surveillance, the militants are showing a growing ambition to use the technology to kill enemies (2).”  The article offers that the Islamic State’s use of lightweight and relatively inexpensive drones shows they can be effective on the battlefield and pose a serious threat to Soldiers and civilians, both physically and psychologically.  The article further emphasizes that the Islamic State is only the latest in a long line of militant organizations that have acquired drones and attempted to modify them for their own purposes.  When recently asked about the growing use of commercial drones by U.S. adversaries, Lieutenant General Michael Nagata, Director of Strategic and Operational Planning at the National Counterterrorism Center, stated, “I believe that is only a harbinger of what is coming as this technology grows in both capability, availability and costs continue to drop.  The question is no longer will somebody be able to do such things some day?  Or how do we stop this from happening in the future?  I would argue this is something we need to be asking ourselves right now (3).” </p>
      <p>In this week’s Professional Reading “Countering the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Threat”, Colonel Matthew Tedesco provides support to Lieutenant General Nagata’s concerns arguing “the U.S. military has been slow to acknowledge the UAS threat and has only recently started to examine the basic requirements to address the challenges associated with UAS defense.”  In his article, Colonel Tedesco offers recommendations for improving the overall Department of Defense capabilities to counter the UAS threat.  Consistent with the AOC, Tedesco’s recommendations stress that to retain overmatch and overcome the UAS threat, the Joint Force will have to combine technologies and integrate efforts across multiple domains.  His recommendations require working with joint, interorganizational, and multinational (JIM) partners to evaluate trends; identifying doctrine, organizations, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) gaps, opportunities, and solutions; and delivering integrated solutions to the force.  Specifically, Tedesco recommends:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The Department of Defense should designate a service or an organization as the proponent for all categories of countering unmanned aircraft systems.</li>
      <li>A joint solution is required to address the challenges of detection and identification in order to improve defeat mechanisms.</li>
      <li>Timely detection is the critical requirement that leads to identification and classification. </li>
      <li>Services must modernize their air and missile defense capabilities and examine other materiel solutions to address the growing threat. </li>
      <li>The services must reexamine joint tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and training required to defeat UAS capabilities.</li>
      <li>Services must pursue a common command and control capability to exercise control of the complex counter unmanned aerial system environment. </li>
      <li>The joint force needs to expand its exercises to address evolving UAS threats.</li>
     
      </ul>       

      <p>Colonel Tedesco’s recommendations support the framework and ends defined in the U.S. Army’s <a href="../App_Documents/Army-CUAS-Strategy.pdf" target"=_blank">Counter – Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS) Strategy</a> published in October of 2016.    The C-UAS strategy seeks to provide forces at all echelons with solutions across the (DOTMLPF-P) framework that will enable defeat of UAS threats. The strategy seeks combined arms solutions, using capabilities from every warfighting function, in a coordinated, synchronized way.  It seeks cross-domain solutions, recognizing that UAS threats impact every domain, not just the air.  Finally, it seeks a whole-of-government approach, recognizing a comprehensive C-UAS capability will involve JIM partners from all areas of government, working together towards a common goal.</p>
      <p>For further information on the C-UAS Strategy, contact Lieutenant Colonel Vince Bailey, Chief, Fires Branch, ARCIC, at 757-501-5375,  vincent.p.bailey4.mil@mail.mil <mailto:vincent.p.bailey4.mil@mail.mil> , or SIPR: vincent.p.bailey4.mil@mail.smil.mil <mailto:vincent.p.bailey4.mil@mail.smil.mil>  </p>
      <p>As you read Colonel Tedesco’s article and the attached extract from the C-UAS strategy consider the DOTMLPF implications for the following Army Warfighting challenges: </p>

	 <p>For the past two decades, assumptions of domain superiority drove the doctrine, equipment, and posture of U.S. forces. These assumptions must now be reviewed and questioned due to advancements in adversary capabilities, capacities, and approaches. Russia has focused their modernization efforts on systems designed to defeat perceived U.S. strengths. Moreover, the velocity of human interaction, compression of events in time, the use of state-sponsored military intimidation, propaganda, deception, disinformation, and the ability of highly empowered individuals to influence disparate populations indicate a changing character of warfare that harnesses cognitive influences. Today we see Russia and China often pursuing informational actions to accomplish objectives as part of a broader national whole of government approach to achieve political ends.</p>
   <p>This week's professional reading "Thinking like a Russian Officer," by Tim Thomas provides a Russian perspective on "new-type" warfare, also known as hybrid war in the West. Thomas discusses recent publications by various Russian authors who aided in the development of Russian military strategy. Thomas observes that these "publications offer a lens to view how Russian officers are evaluating the military and the geopolitical landscape in front of them." Citing retired Russian officers S. G. Chekinov and S. A. Bogdanov, "future wars will be resolved by a skillful combination of military, nonmilitary, and special nonviolent measures that will be put through by a variety of forms and methods and a blend of political, economic, informational, technological, and environmental measures, primarily by taking advantage of information superiority." Thomas concludes by highlighting that a consistent theme through many contemporary Russian publications "strategic goals will not be achieved in future wars unless information superiority is assured over the enemy, including employment of various actions to influence the behavior of the armed forces personnel and population of the adversary country to instigate internal tensions (split) in society."</p>
   <p>This week's reading reminds us that future U.S. Army forces will operate not only on physical battlegrounds but also in the contested spaces of information and public perception. Leaders must understand how to use information to fight effectively in those contested spaces and consider information operations as an integral part of planning and execution across the range of military operations. Concept development for Multi-Domain Battle provides an excellent opportunity to examine how we can expand physical and cognitive maneuver in time, space, and purpose across multiple domains. Refining and operationalizing the concept of "Expanding Maneuver" allows the Army to achieve greater clarity on how the Department of Defense might expand strategic options for our National leaders in terms of time, decision space, and approaches for the early 21st Century security environment.</p>
   <p>On 5 April 2017, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) is sponsoring an Expanding Maneuver Senior Leader Forum. The purpose of the forum is to stimulate operational and strategic level discussion to inform outcomes for further consideration across the community of interest. Specifically, the forum will focus on expanding the current frame for Unified Land Operations beyond physical to consider outmaneuvering adversaries both physically and cognitively to ensure the Army and the Joint Force are better postured to maintain a competitive edge over our Nation's adversaries.</p>

		    <p>Acting Director Major General Robert “Bo” Dyess’ Comments:</p>		
			<p>Team</p>	
		<p>During his 8 February hearing with the Senate Armed Services
subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, General Allyn, the Vice
Chief of Staff, testified that the Army is "outranged, outgunned and
outdated."  While consistent, predictable funding is desired, last week's
reading reminded us that our complex world is characterized by change and
uncertainty and the Army must plan accordingly. This week's professional
reading underscores the importance of thinking clearly about the problem of
future war to develop solutions for today and tomorrow, emphasizing the
urgent need to both fix systems and develop new capabilities.</p>		

<p> In "The Future of the Army," David Barno and Nora Bensahel,
Nonresident Senior Fellows at the Brent Scowcroft Center on International
Security at the Atlantic Council, observe that the combination of a
shrinking force, declining resources, increasing global commitments, and the
renewed possibility of major power conflict present the Army with momentous
strategic challenges. Barno and Bensahel argue that Army leaders must
approach these challenges with imagination, creative solutions, and
unrestrained thinking and take action now in order to ensure that the Army
is prepared for current and future challenges.</p>
<p>  Barno and Bensahel present recommendations for today
(2016-2020); tomorrow (2020-2025); and the day after tomorrow (2025-2040 and
beyond). Their recommendations are listed below and the full description of
each can be found in the article:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Today (2016-2020):</p>  Adjust force structure to better meet operational
  requirements</li>
  <li> Fully integrate the Army's Active and Reserve</li>
  <li>Rebuild joint and combined arms warfighting capabilities</li>
  <li> Transform Army headquarters and slash nonessential processes</li>
  <li>Reconstitute capabilities for rapid expansion</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><p>Tomorrow (2020-2025):</p></li>
  <li>Organize the total force by deployment timelines</li>
  <li> Strengthen Army strategic mobility and presence</li>
  <li>Master urban operations</li>
  <li>Prepare for the next big war</li>
  <li>Modernize technology investments</li>
  <li>Set the stage for another round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).
</li>
</ul>
 <ul>
  <li><p>The day after tomorrow (2025-2040 and beyond):</p></li>
  <li>Transform Army culture</li>
  <li>Redesign the structures of the operational and institutional Army</li>
  <li>Expand personnel reforms and definitions of service.</li>
  <li>Embrace advanced technologies and experimentation</li>       
 </ul>
<p>Adversaries will continue to invest in technology to erode
U.S. overmatch.  In some areas, however, they have already achieved parity
or can overmatch US capabilities. There is an urgent need to improve and
develop new capabilities to replace the "work horses" (big 5) that have
served us so well.  During this week's modernization hearing LTG Murray
noted that the "Abrams tank is still towards the top of its class in terms
of combat systems but "there is parity out there... I don't think we have
overmatch." Without a replacement for the M1 Abrams under development there
is a very real possibility that the Army will remain outgunned, outranged,
and outdated during the next conflict.  Murray observed that we must also be
thinking about other systems to regain overmatch.   Barno and Bensahel's
recommendations offer potential solutions to regain overmatch and ensure
that the Army is prepared for the demanding challenges of the future.  As
you read this week's article, consider their recommendations and the
challenges and opportunities they present.</p>

			<p>	"Change will not happen on a certain day, or even in a year. In fact we're undergoing that change right now as we sit here, and we've been in the midst of it for some time. That change is evolutionary, not revolutionary. But it is no less profound." </p>

		    <p>Acting Director Major General Robert “Bo” Dyess’ Comments:</p>		
			<p>Team</p>	
			<p> In a recent ARCIC weekly reading, General Donn Starry reminded us in "Running Things" that a sound vision with achievable goals, benchmarks, and plans will enable organizations at every echelon of command to succeed in an environment characterized by "constant, unceasing, and ever-accelerating" change. To this end, Army professionals must continue to think clearly about the problem of future armed conflict as threats, enemies, and adversaries are becoming increasingly capable and elusive.  As the Army Operating Concept indicates, we live in a complex world with a future that is not only unknown, but also unknowable, and constantly changing. </p>
			<p>This week's professional reading is a letter drafted by Lin Wells in 2001 that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent to President George W. Bush that succinctly describes major shifts in the strategic environment during each decade of the century. Wells' letter is a brief but powerful reminder of the continual change that occurs in our complex world. Consider the change that occurred in the last two decades. In 2001 when Wells wrote his letter, hardly anyone knew that Al Qaeda existed, thousands of US forces were deployed to the Balkans, and the entire V Corps consisting of two divisions and separate brigades were stationed in Germany. By 2010, a Balkan state joined NATO, US forces were withdrawing from Iraq and increasing in Afghanistan, and no one had ever heard of ISIS. Today, U.S. and Iraqi forces are fighting ISIS, the US has one Army BCT permanently stationed in Germany, and the shadow of great-power conflict re-emerged.   </p>
			<p>While there is no way to predict what will occur in the future, the Army thinks clearly about the changing character of future armed conflict by considering threats, enemies, and adversaries, anticipated missions, emerging technologies, opportunities to use existing capabilities in new ways, and historical observations and lessons learned. A failure to think clearly about the changes in future armed conflict risks what nineteenth century Prussian philosopher Carl von Clausewitz warned against: regarding war as "something autonomous" rather than "an instrument of policy," misunderstanding "the kind of war on which we are embarking," and trying to turn war into "something that is alien to its nature." </p>

			<p>Future armed conflict will consist of state and non-state actors who employ traditional, unconventional, and hybrid strategies that threaten U.S. security and vital interests. Enemies and adversaries will challenge U.S. competitive advantages in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains. Future enemies will not be passive recipients of our military prowess; they will make every effort to avoid U.S. strengths, emulate advanced capabilities, and disrupt advantages. Enemies and adversaries will expand operations to the battlegrounds of perception, political subversion, and criminality. Ultimately, as Clausewitz reinforced, war is and will remain a “contest of wills.” </p>
			<p>The Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and invasion of Ukraine using conventional and unconventional land forces suggests that Russia is determined to expand its territory and assert power on the Eurasian landmass. Russia deployed and integrated a range of diplomatic, information, military, and economic means to pursue their goals below the threshold that would elicit a concerted North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) response. Russia tailors their actions to the conditions of the specific conflict to include the combination of information operations, cyber/electronic warfare capabilities, and social media to influence perceptions at home and abroad and provide cover for large-scale military operations. Russia also incorporates special operations to prepare, infiltrate, isolate, and incite dissent and disruption in the target nation.  </p>
			<p>Russia’s revisionist stance and reemergence as a strategic competitor place renewed importance for Army leaders to understand the conceptual basis for Russian actions. To do so, Army leaders must possess a firm understanding of Russian strategic culture.  In “The Culture of Strategic Thought Behind Russia’s Modern Approaches to Warfare,” Stephen R. Covington argues that Russian decision making is best understood through the lens of four fundamental and mutually reinforcing assumptions that constitute the pillars of Russian strategic culture:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Strategic uniqueness demands unique military approaches to maximize and seize opportunity</li>
			<li>Strategic vulnerability demands aggressive counter-surprise measures for a Russia perceived as potentially ‘undefendable’</li>
			<li>Going to war with Russia means “Going to war with all of Russia”</li>
			<li>The decisiveness of the initial period of war</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each pillar reflects Russia’s current military thinking on war. Today, Russia uses hybrid warfare to advance their strengths by exploiting an adversary’s weaknesses. Covington compares the word hybrid in this instance to the way it is used in a hybrid car—a single vehicle with two distinct but interacting sources of power. Russian hybrid warfare combines both ambiguous methods of war with conventional and nuclear forces within a single coherent strategy. This approach involving conventional and nuclear posturing—from the outset—serves as a shield for the use of ambiguous means. Covington argues “War with Russia means going to war with all of Russia.” Russia will employ “nation-wide, force-wide, integrated strategies united through strategic operations.” Russia prioritizes thinking and preparing for war holistically at the strategic-level and their strategic culture places a greater emphasis on escalation rather than de-escalation to terminate a conflict. </p>
			<p>The Russian General Staff continues the Soviet tradition of emphasizing the importance of the initial period of the war and organizes their force according to their assessment of the opening round of hostilities. Fundamental to this is the goal, born of the destruction of the Great Patriotic War, never to wage another conflict on Russian territory. The Russians believe that any conflict with the West will be “characterized by lightning fast, hybrid blitzkrieg actions…to achieve decisive strategic political and military results in a very short period with minimum preparations.” The Russians intend to compete across all domains to seize the strategic initiative from the outset and control the initial period of the war. “This unique, asymmetric path is an enduring, multi-dimensional challenge for the West, one that will impact Europe’s security and sense of well-being for years to come.” </p>
			<p>Steven Covington’s essay reinforces the Army Operating Concept's stipulation that “Army leaders need to balance the technological focus of Army modernization with a recognition of the limits of technology and an emphasis on the human, cultural, and political continuities of armed conflict.” An understanding of the cultural and political continuities of armed conflict are essential when organizing, training, equipping and posturing future Army forces to deter adversaries, and if necessary, defeat enemies. </p>

			<p>The Army thinks clearly about the future armed conflict by considering history and how historical lessons relate to the future operational environment. As historian Sir Michael Howard wrote in his 1981 essay military officers should study military history in width, depth, and context. By observing how warfare developed over the course of history, studying campaigns, and understanding the context of war's social, cultural, economic, human, moral, political, and psychological dimensions, the study of military history will not make men cleverer for the next time but, instead, "make them wise forever." This week's professional reading provides historical insight on how a nineteenth century force conducted expeditionary maneuver and how it relates to the contemporary environment.  </p>
			<p>Expeditionary maneuver is the rapid deployment of task-organized combined arms forces able to transition quickly and conduct operations of sufficient scale and ample duration to achieve strategic objectives. In "Expeditionary Land Power: Lessons from the Mexican-American War," MAJ Nathan Jennings examines how a "relatively small, technologically advanced, and professionally led" force deployed to distant theaters. He contends that the operational phases of shape, deter, seize initiative, dominate, stabilize, and enable civil authority, as outlined in Joint Publication 3-0, Joint Operations, provide a ready conceptual framework to contextualize the nineteenth-century confrontation. Jennings argues that the implications of the Mexican-American War remain relevant today: land forces must train and equip to win across all the phases of expeditionary warfare to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative and defeat increasingly capable enemies.  </p>
			<p>Jenning’s article reinforces the Army's effort to improve expeditionary maneuver capabilities. The Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) is the Army's most deployable formation but lacks mobility once deployed and requires additional firepower and protection to maintain freedom of movement and action in close combat with capable enemies. To improve the IBCT's capabilities, the Army is pursuing the following vehicles: the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV); the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV); and the Mobile Protected Fire power (MPF) combat vehicle. The GMV, LRV, and MPF form an integrated suite of vehicles that close IBCT capability gaps in mobility, protection, and lethality. </p>
			<p>As you read this week's essay, consider your professional reading program. How are the officers, NCOs, and Soldiers in your organizations studying military history in width, depth, and context to discern the applicable lessons and apply them to today? </p>

		    <p>Acting Director Major General Robert “Bo” Dyess’ Comments:</p>
			<p>Team</p>	
			<p>U.S. Army forces are able to conduct joint combined arms operations because Army leaders thrive in environments of uncertainty and danger.  Army Leaders solve problems, prioritize resources, achieve objectives, and manage the complications of complexity and change.  As General Donn Starry illustrates in this week’s professional reading, Army leaders execute these tasks as “a matter of running things.” In his 1987 article “Running Things,” General Donn Starry, former TRADOC Commanding General, contends change is one of the most elemental complications in running an organization.  
Starry argues that leaders and managers must adapt to the rate of change while pursuing consistent goals and objectives.  
</p>
<p>To run an organization effectively Starry identifies four factors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Vision – A vision must be believable and achievable.</li>
				<li>Strategy – Organizations must have a description of how they will achieve the vision. </li>
				<li>Operations – Leaders must understand what operations they must accomplish to achieve the strategy.</li>
				<li>Tactics – Individuals at all levels must understand how their actions contribute to enable operations.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A sound vision with achievable goals, benchmarks, and plans will enable organizations at every echelon of command to succeed in an environment characterized by “constant, unceasing, and ever-accelerating” change.  In addition,   Starry also identifies an important attribute for leaders and managers: “To win it is necessary to seize the initiative; and the person running things is responsible for taking the initiative.”  Starry’s essay is consistent with the Army Operating Concept’s central idea that in environments characterized by continual change Army forces must adapt to seize, retain, and then exploit initiative. </p>
			<p>As Starry points out leaders that seize the initiative and possess a sound plan with clear and achievable goals will enable the Army to manage a complex and uncertain future. To achieve the Army’s vision of the future, the Future Force Development Strategy (FFDS) outlines initiatives that will enable the Army to protect the homeland, foster security abroad, and win wars.  For Army forces to defeat enemy organizations, control terrain, secure populations, consolidate </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maintain overmatch in Soldier and team performance</li>
				<li>Ensure combat units are fundamentally sound</li>
				<li>Field advanced protection systems to legacy systems</li>
				<li>Field space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic capabilities</li>
				<li>Apply robotic and autonomous technologies across the force</li>
				<li>Improve the lethality, mobility, and protection of combat units</li>
				<li>Regain superiority in cross-domain fires</li>
				<li>Expand overmatch to operational distances</li>
				<li>Seize the opportunity of new aviation technologies</li>
				<li>Develop solutions for combat vehicle modernization</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The combination of a dangerously reduced force, less forward presence, and a lost generation of modernization will create the possibility that in the future Soldiers will operate at both a quantitative and qualitative disadvantage.  Implementing these initiatives will ensure that future Army forces possess the readiness, capabilities, and capacity to protect our nation, deter conflict, and if necessary, defeat increasingly capable enemies and adversaries.</p>

			<p>Combat vehicles have proven their value in all types of terrain and tactical environments from open desert to mountains, jungles, and cities. Combat vehicles are essential to joint combined arms operations; operations that integrate infantry, armor, artillery, engineers, aviation, and joint capabilities to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative over the enemy. Combat vehicles provide capabilities to Soldiers that enhance their ability to fight, including networked communications, load carrying, and power generation. Most importantly, combat vehicles provide Soldiers with the mobility, protection, and lethality to gain positional and temporal advantages over enemy forces in close combat. This week’s reading highlights the importance of a modernized combat vehicle fleet in ensuring future Soldiers and Joint Teams are prepared to fight, win, and survive in future armed conflict.  </p>
			<p>In “Selected Foreign Counterparts of U.S. Army Ground Combat Systems and Implications for Combat Operations and Modernization” Andrew Feickert, of the Congressional Research Service, examines U.S. and foreign ground combat systems to determine the implications for U.S. ground combat system modernization. Feickert observes that efforts to modernize the U.S. Army’s current fleet of combat vehicles – vehicles that were fielded in the 1980s to counter the Soviet Union – have not always been successful and in the not-too-distant future, foreign armored vehicle design and capabilities could surpass existing U.S. systems. Feickert identifies the following implications for US Army ground modernization efforts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>U.S. ground combat systems could be outpaced by foreign systems</li>
				<li>Increasingly capable foreign ground combat systems could be an option for acquisition</li>
				<li>Old Threats are New Again: The lack of short-range air defense, artillery, and Electronic Warfare capabilities represents a significant vulnerability to U.S. Ground Forces </li>
				<li>Greater consideration should be given to the following systems: Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) and Fire Control Systems (FCS); Active Protection Systems (APS); Cluster Munitions Ban-compliant artillery rounds and rocket warheads; and digitally enhanced and longer-ranged artillery and rocket systems </li>
			 </ul>
			<p>This week’s reading reminds us that to provide close combat overmatch on increasingly lethal battlefields, the Army must modernize its combat vehicle fleet and develop the next generation combat vehicle – a platform that integrates the latest technologies and innovative engineering concepts that enable future Soldiers and Joint teams to fight, win, and survive on tomorrow’s battlefields. Our Army recognizes that risk to Soldiers is increasing due to inadequate investment in combat vehicle modernization. Modernizing is expensive, but the costs of entering a conflict outgunned, outranged, and outdated are far greater. Empowering U.S. ground combat forces to fight effectively against sophisticated enemies demands restoring parity or providing capacity overmatch in critical capabilities. Attaining parity entails restoring, at a minimum, equivalency of warfighting capabilities.  </p>
			<p>On 28 February 2017, the Maneuver Center of Excellence is hosting the Combat Vehicle Modernization Summit at Fort Benning, GA. Representatives from throughout the Army will discuss the required capabilities and emerging technologies required for ground forces to maintain overmatch. Ground forces with overmatching capabilities operate across domains to sense, close with, and destroy enemy elements, operate effectively in complex terrain, influence and protect populations, and seize and occupy or control terrain to consolidate gains. Ground forces that possess overmatch enable the Joint Force by creating multiple options for commanders while presenting multiple dilemmas for the enemy. The following actions are some of the most important that the Army must take to maintain overmatch in the future:</p>
			<p>Ensure combat units are fundamentally sound - Adapt tactical formations to the future operational environment by increasing elements that experimentation demonstrates have been cut too far (e.g. engineers, reconnaissance, and mechanized infantry) and restoring those capabilities that were largely abandoned due to earlier efforts at joint interdependence (e.g. short-range air defense)</p>
			<p>Protect our legacy systems - Until the Army fields combat vehicles with integral active protection systems, existing vehicles require interim improvements immediately to deal with increasingly lethal and emerging threats.  </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Accelerate Active Protective System for combat vehicle platforms (3 ABCTs, 1 SBCT) </li>
			<li>Accelerate Vehicle Protection Suite (Modular Active Protection System)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Restore lethality and mobility of ground forces - Field systems to the Army’s ground maneuver formations to improve tactical mobility upon arrival and the lethality necessary to enhance close combat overmatch capabilities.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Pursue a Least to Most modernization strategy for M1A1 AIM-SA and M2A2 ODS fleets</li>
			<li>Replace obsolete M113s with AMPV (500) in Echelon above Brigade units</li>
			<li>Fund development of next generation ATGM to replace TOW II </li>
			<li>Accelerate production of M1A2SEPv3 and M2A4 to 1x ABCT per year </li>
			<li>Accelerate M88 development to regain single vehicle recovery </li>
			<li>Field AMPV (256) to Brigade Engineer Battalions in ABCTs </li>
			<li>Pursue objective Light Reconnaissance Vehicle </li>
			<li>Expand Ground Mobility Vehicles fielding beyond 177 vehicles, 3 BCT sets </li>
			<li>Field BFVs (1,238) to return x2 MECH IN COs and CAB Standard Scout PLTs to the ABCT.</li>
			<li>Divest HMMWVs and replace with JLTVs for total operating force LTV requirement of 85,802</li>
			<li>Replace Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS) with Enhanced HETS to support combat loaded M1A2 SEPV2 or M1A2 SEP V3</li>
			<li>Expedite the development and fielding of advanced Terrain Shaping capability </li>
			<li>Enhance armored formation mobility by replacing and upgrading Armored Combat Earthmover </li>
			
			</ul>
			<p>Regain superiority in cross-domain fires and maneuver - Improve the range, lethality, and capacity (organization and munitions) of fires in order to support maneuver, defense against enemy air attack, and counter enemy-long range indirect fire systems.</p>
			<p>Initiate Research, Development and Prototyping for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle</p>

			<p>Team</p>	
			<p>Wars today are fought for the same reasons the Greek historian Thucydides identified nearly 2,500 years ago: fear, honor, and interest. Many of the difficulties encountered in strategic decision making and operational planning stem from a neglect of continuities in the nature of war. The cultural, social, economic, religious, and historical considerations that comprise the human aspects of war must inform wartime planning as well as our preparation for future armed conflict.  A failure to consider the human aspects of war risks, as General Carl Vuono observes in this week’s essay, that future generations “will pay for our irresponsibility with their treasure and possibly with their blood.”   General Vuono emphasizes the value of capable, credible conventional land forces to deter threats and defend U.S. global interests, especially during periods of change.  He underscores the importance of understanding continuities in the nature of war as well as recognizing changes in the character of armed conflict. </p>
			<p>During the early 1990s, policy makers and strategists were enthusiastic about the Peace Dividend. In his prophetic 1990 essay, “The Strategic Value of Conventional Forces,” General Carl Vuono, former U.S. Army Chief of Staff, observed that the world will remain complex long after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  To “remain prepared to deal with the military capabilities of a host of foes,” in such a complex world, Vuono stressed the need to maintain ready land forces that can be adapted quickly to deal with the ever-widening range of challenges. </p>
			<p>Vuono listed three attributes for conventional land forces: versatility, deployability, and lethality.  Land Forces must be capable of responding to a widening array of challenges while drawing from the same reservoir of forces. Versatility requires retaining combat power in units forward deployed in Europe, Asia, Central America, and in other areas where forward presence is vital to protect and defend US interests. Second, conventional land forces must be deployable - able to project substantial combat power rapidly wherever our interests are threatened.  Finally, conventional land forces must be lethal - lethal to bolster deterrence and lethal to ensure defense. Lethality demands modern weapons, tough and realistic training, and “young Americans of character and ability who volunteer to fill our ranks.”  Combined, all three attributes enable Army forces to succeed in what Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley has described as the “unforgiving environment of ground combat” during his 2015 speech when assuming duties as the 39th Chief of Staff, U.S. Army.  Otherwise, as Milley stated, “we will pay the butcher's bill in blood.”  </p>
			<p>Our Army requires modernized combat vehicles across all formations because Vuono’s 1990 observation remains true today: “conflict remains a way of life and the principles of freedom and democracy remain very much at risk.”  Innovative and crosscutting technologies are essential to improve the future force’s combat effectiveness through reduced logistical demand, improved reliability and reduced life cycle costs, and simpler systems that are easier to operate and sustain. Synthetic and live prototyping will improve our ability to innovate and integrate new technologies with well-trained soldiers and teams. Neglecting to do so leaves the Army in danger of paying the “butcher’s bill” during future conflicts.</p>
			<p>Vuono’s article reminds us that anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character for armed conflict. As you read this essay, consider the capabilities our Army requires to protect the nation and our vital interests.</p>

			<p>Team</p>	
			<p>Sustaining land forces has challenged Army leaders for as long as there has been organized warfare. From ancient times to the present, force sustainment has often determined the difference between victory and defeat.  Sustainment is comprised of the support and services that allow land forces to conduct campaigns.  Without effective sustainment, armies do not possess the operational reach or endurance necessary to prevail in war.  Sustainment operations in future armed conflict will be difficult because joint combined arms maneuver requires transporting and sustaining geographically dispersed forces over long distances in contested environments.  To sustain forces in future war, our Army must innovate to close capability gaps in survivability and the ability to distribute support across wide areas and at the end of extended and contested lines of communication.  This week's reading highlights emerging capabilities that hold promise for improving future force combat effectiveness through uninterrupted sustainment and distribution.</p>
			<p>In their 2015 article, Tooth to Tail, Ms. Munira Tourner and Mr. Michael Clow argue that to expand and increase combat power, lethality, and flexibility the Army must unburden Soldiers by reducing convoy manning requirements, logistical footprints, fuel and water requirements, weight and other factors through demand reduction. </p>
			<p>During the 2016, AUSA Eisenhower address, Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley predicted that on future battlefields, "resupply convoys will likely be autonomous robots or remotely controlled convoys because they will be the only acceptable method of supply." Our Army is experimenting with automated technologies today. In October 2016, Army Warfighting Assessment (AWA) 17.1, a Force 2025 Maneuvers venue, included Leader-Follower capabilities for experimentation. AWA identified minor technical limitations - e.g. a lack of a reverse capability - but the Leader-Follower prototypes demonstrated they were functionally sound by executing twenty-six sustainment missions over distances that exceeded 2,000 miles. Moreover, in AWA 17.1's AAR Sustainment leaders indicated Leader-Follower is a future "force multiplier" that increased "the flexibility and capacity of sustainment vehicles."  The development of this capability is an example of how Army leaders must think clearly about future armed conflict; learn from intellectual and physical activities; analyze what they learn; and implement those solutions to ensure the Joint Force's ability to fight, win, and survive in future armed conflict.</p>

			<p>Our Army learns in a focused, sustained, and collaborative manner under the framework of Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs, see link below) and through Force 2025 Maneuvers. AWFCs are enduring questions that help integrate force modernization efforts and allow Soldiers, leaders, and units to drive future force development. Force 2025 Maneuvers encompass the intellectual and physical activities that help leaders learn and develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges. </p>
			<p>The Army analyzes what it learns to define high risk problems (i.e. capability gaps), develop integrated solutions and prioritize efforts.  Learning events such as experiments, wargames, and the Army Warfighting Assessment ensure sound investments in future capabilities.  Ultimately, Army leaders implement solutions to ensure the Joint Force's ability to win.  This week's professional reading provides a historical perspective on how our Army thought clearly about a problem, learned through experimentation, analyzed the results of learning activities, and implemented solutions to create lasting change.</p>
			<p>In 1962 Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara directed Secretary of the Army Elvis J. Stahr to evaluate rotary-wing aviation's potential during warfare.  McNamara insisted that Stahr take a "bold new look, divorced from traditional viewpoints and past policies, and free from veto or dilution by conservative staff review." A board of officers, led by LTG Hamilton Howze, evaluated every aspect of air mobility to determine how helicopters could be best integrated into tactical operations.  To test the recommendations proposed by "The Howze Board," Army Chief of Staff General Earl Wheeler formed the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) as a dedicated test and evaluation unit.  How the Howze Board and 11th Air Assault Division thought, learned, analyzed, and implemented DOTMLPF solutions for Air Mobility operations serves as a model for developing solutions to warfighting challenges.</p>
			<p>In his monograph, "Transforming the Force:  The 11th Air Assault Division (Test) from 1963-1965," then-Major, now Brigadier General Thomas Graves, observes that the Howze Board and the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) -  a dedicated test and experimentation unit -  were essential in developing a combat capability that remains vital today.  As Graves observes, "overall, the [Howze] Board provided a lasting contribution to the US Army."  Many countries experimented with helicopters, but only the US Army conducted a full examination of institutional changes necessary for successful large scale helicopter operations and employment. Through rigorous analysis in wargames, simulations, and exercises, the board developed recommendations based on "seemingly irrefutable proof of the efficacy of air mobility." Rigorous analysis and sustained learning in an organization that combined new technology with well-trained Soldiers, leaders, and teams, delivered integrated solutions and built senior-leader consensus behind recommendations. Ultimately, an effort based on thinking, learning, analysis, and implementation dramatically improved the combat effectiveness of Army units during the Vietnam War and beyond.</p>
			<p>Many of the (Howze Board's) processes and methodologies and those of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) remain in practice today.  For example, the Brigade Modernization Command (soon to be renamed as the U.S. Army Joint Modernization Command) and Centers of Excellence (CoE) collaborate to develop solutions to capability gaps that integrate doctrine, organizations, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) recommendations. In the 1960s, the 11th Air Assault Division evaluated air mobility in relevant scenarios against real threats: a modern threat (Warsaw Pact Nations), Pacific threat (China), Insurgency (Vietnamese Communists), and other regional threats (South America).  Today, the Army
Warfighting Assessment incorporates scenarios that replicate emerging threats, enemies, and adversaries in realistic operational environments.
</p>
			<p>Although the Army's loss of a dedicated unit for experimentation due to the combination of increasing operational requirements and reductions in the size of the force will disadvantage future force development efforts, Army leaders will mitigate negative effects of that loss through the rotation of units into the Army's Network Integration Evaluation and Army Warfighting Assessment until an experimental force can be re-built or re-designated. The Army will also continue to conduct live experimentation during exercises and in other campaign of learning venues such as the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment at Fort Benning and the Maneuver Fires Integration Experiment at Fort Sill.  </p>
			<p>Readers might consider what emerging technologies, like the helicopter nearly sixty years ago, have potential to ensure the combat effectiveness of the future force if integrated effectively into Army organizations.  Also, BG Graves' excellent monograph, written while a student in our Army's School of Advanced Military Studies, demonstrates the importance of reading, researching and writing about our profession to advance expert knowledge and ensure that leaders are prepared for greater responsibilities in operational and institutional assignments.</p>

			<p>Team</p>	
			<p>Innovation is the act or process of introducing something new, or
creating new uses for existing designs.  In our Army, we emphasize the need
to turn ideas into valued outcomes as well as the need to do so faster than
determined and adaptive adversaries.  To innovate, Army leaders think
clearly about future armed conflict; learn from intellectual and physical
activities; analyze what they learn; and implement those solutions to ensure
the Joint Force's ability to win. Successful innovation requires focused and
sustained collaboration among Army professionals to determine what
capabilities our Army must develop to ensure overmatch against increasingly
capable enemies.  The cyberspace domain poses unique challenges for
innovation due to the rapid pace of technological change.  This week's
professional reading examines how organizations innovate successfully in
rapidly changing environments and reinforces the need for focused,
sustained, and collaborative learning across our Army.
</p>
			<p>In "Cyber Beyond Third Offset:  A Call for Warfighter-Led Innovation,"
Dr. Nina Kollars and Jacquelyn Schneider observe that successful military
organizations foster collaboration and facilitate learning between
warfighters and capability developers.  The authors advocate for bottom-up
processes and problem-oriented approaches to innovation to foster
collaboration.  Collaboration allows organizations to identify problems,
develop solutions, and then implement those solutions quickly. Ultimately,
innovations in cyberspace must fit into actual combat through strong
connections between capability developers and warfighters.
</p>
			<p>To maintain operational effectiveness in cyberspace, our Army must
rapidly identify problems, develop solutions, and then implement those
solutions.  The authors contend that centralized organizations and top-down
processes often overlook innovations developed at warfighter level and tend
to create organizational stove pipes.  Kollars and Schneider propose three
measures to ensure that centralized organizations (like our Army) are able
to collaborate and innovate for cyberspace:
</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Expand initiatives to include warfighters.</li>
			<li>Overcome cultural barriers that inhibit warfighter-led cyberspace innovation.</li>
			<li>Integrate the cyber mission at all echelons.</li>
			
			</ul>
			<p>Kollars' and Schnieder's essay amplifies the importance of the Army's Campaign of Learning under Force 2025 Maneuvers. </p>
			<p>     Army Force 2025 Maneuvers (F2025M) events such as the Army Warfighting
Assessment (AWA), Cyber Quest, and Cyber Blitz foster collaborative learning
and provide venues to connect capability developers with warfighters to
solve pressing problems.  For example, Cyber Blitz I, which occurred in 2016,
brought together members of TRADOC, ASA(ALT), CERDEC, the 25th Infantry
Division, and the Army Cyber Protection Brigade.  Cyber Blitz II (17-28
April 2017) will build on the success of Cyber Blitz I.  Seminars,
experiments, wargames and exercises enable leaders to
think clearly about future war, learn through collaboration and
experimentation, analyze what they learned, and then implement solutions.

			<p>"...an armed attack against one ... shall be considered an attack against them all." </p>
			<footer>Article V, North Atlantic Treaty Organization Charter </footer>
	   </blockquote>
	   
			<p>Since its formation in 1949, North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
(NATO) first goal has been conflict prevention. During the Cold War,
deterrence in Europe depended on the synergistic effect of a globally
responsive and forward positioned Joint Force - to include land forces
capable of operating in sufficient scale to deny enemy objectives. Air and
naval forces contribute indispensable capabilities to the Joint Force, but
land forces are essential to joint and multinational deterrence by denial --
convincing the enemy
that he cannot accomplish his objectives through the use of force. This
week's professional reading emphasizes the role of ready NATO land forces as
a capable and credible deterrent to prevent war.
</p>
			<p>     In "NATO's Land Force: Strength and Speed Matter," General John
Nicholson, the Commander of Resolute Support and United States Forces -
Afghanistan and former commander of NATO Land Forces Command, argues that
NATO achieves deterrence through ready forces that combine strength and
speed.  Nicholson proposes six measures to ensure that NATO land forces are
ready to operate with speed and strength:  
</p>
			<ul>			
			<li>Ensure the intelligence enterprise provides timely indicators and warnings of aggression.</li>
			<li>Close the gap in current NATO Rapid Response timetables.</li>
			<li>Pre-position US equipment to permit rapid reinforcement.</li>
			<li>Develop and test effective counters to Russian A2/AD capabilities.</li>
			<li>Strengthen land force capabilities and modernize forces for inter-state, high-intensity conflict.</li>
			<li>Re-examine training and doctrine to ensure land forces are capable of countering a peer competitor. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Ensuring that NATO land forces are capable of deterrence by denial
requires a high degree of interoperability.  The Army Warfighting Assessment
(AWA), as the Chief of Staff Army's annual capstone exercise in the Army's
Force 2025 Maneuvers (F2025M), builds interoperability while informing
future force development.  AWA enables the Army to maintain readiness today
while ensuring readiness for the future.  
</p>
			<p>As you read this week's professional reading consider additional ways
the Army can ensure readiness and interoperability to prevent conflict,
shape security environments, and, if necessary, fight and win as part of a
joint and multinational team.  
</p>

		 <blockquote>
			<p>"We clearly see that the activities characteristic of war may be split into two main categories: those that are merely preparations for war, and war proper"</p>
			<footer>Carl von Clausewitz, On War</footer>
	   </blockquote>
						
			<p>Team</p>			
			<p>As part of the joint force, the Army defeats enemy forces, controls terrain, secures populations, consolidates gains, preserves joint force freedom of action, and establishes the conditions for lasting peace. To execute these tasks the Army requires capacity, capabilities, readiness, skill, and Soldiers.  Determining the right balance between capacity, capabilities, modernization, and readiness for today and tomorrow is the responsibility of Army leaders and the Army staff supported by the Institutional Army (including Training and Doctrine Command, Army Material Command, and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  This week's reading illustrates how a service's institutions establish the foundation for the success or failure of the operating forces that fight America's wars.  </p>
			<p>In "The Institutional Level of War," MAJ Daniel Sukman argues that a critical component of a nation's ability to generate military power resides in the institutions dedicated to developing the doctrine, capabilities, organization, and training of its forces. Sukman defines the institutional level of war as "an overarching level of war where a nation's military services develop material and non-material capabilities, including technology and people, to execute the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare."  Sukman contends that the capacity of the US military to fund and field an institutional force is an asymmetric advantage over enemies and adversaries since smaller nations have significantly less capacity to generate forces. </p>
			<p>General Schwarzkopf is often credited with the lopsided military victory in Operation Desert Storm, but Sukman points out that the institutional Army deserves a share of the credit.  Well before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, institutions refined and inculcated the Air-Land Battle Concept and doctrine, modernized the force, improved interoperability, and trained soldiers.  Capabilities such as Global Positioning Systems and Precision Guided Munitions, Patriot Missile Systems and their associated Air Defense Units, and the creation of the National Training Center for Brigade Combat Team training were developed by the institution years before General Schwarzkopf executed Operation Desert Storm. Sukman's observation that operational success is often predicated on institutional activities that occur in the years preceding an operation reminds us that a focus on future readiness is essential to combat effectiveness in wartime.  
Military institutions must innovate across DOTMLPF to drive the development of new tools and methods that permit future forces to defeat determined enemies and accomplish complex missions.
</p>
			<p>Sukman also highlights that individuals serving in institutional positions must be competent in the practice of "institutional art." Institutional art includes understanding the systems, sub-systems and processes by which the Army runs in the context of national, defense, and joint-level strategy, structure, and resources.  Members of the institutional force must not only understand the Strategic Portfolio Analysis Review (SPAR) process to establish future force priorities, but also how to manage and apply resources to make those priorities happen.  Proficiency in institutional art will enable leaders to drive change that will ensure the Army is prepared to prevent conflict, shape the security environment, and when necessary, win wars.</p>
			<p>There are numerous Army and Joint processes to develop capabilities and to modernize the force.  Process, however, is not a unifying theory. Without an overarching theory of institutional action, processes between the institutional and operational forces can become disconnected.  The Army Operating Concept
(AOC) describes our Army's Think - Learn - Analyze - Implement paradigm as the basis for innovation and future force development.  Army leaders must think clearly about future armed conflict; learn from intellectual and physical activities to gain a better understanding; analyze what they learn to identify capability gaps and prioritize potential solutions to overmatch future enemies; and implement those solutions to ensure the Joint Force's ability to win.  This paradigm requires a focused, sustained, and collaborative effort across the institutional Army, the operating force, the joint community, industry, academia, and other inter-organizational and multinational partners. 
</p>
			<p>As Sukman points out, the development and advancement of knowledge necessary to improve the force should not be regarded as a distraction from ongoing operations. The Army must continue to invest in and deliver future force capabilities to maintain a competitive advantage against increasingly capable and determined adversaries. Army core competencies and tenets are descriptive in nature and provide guidelines for Army leaders to succeed in dangerous environments while providing a foundation for leader development, force design, and unit training. Army leaders recognize that sustained collaboration and learning across the Army allows the Army to balance current readiness and investment in future capabilities. Recognizing the value of the institutional level of war and the contributions of leaders practicing institutional art enables the US to maintain our asymmetric advantage for decades to come.</p>

			<p>Team</p>	
			<p><span class="text-warning">Happy New Year!</span>  This week's reading provides a historical perspective on how joint combined arms maneuver enables joint forces to access contested domains.  It reinforces the importance of expeditionary maneuver and joint combined arms operations to defeat sensor-rich militaries that employ both massed and precision-guided munitions on highly lethal battlefields.  It also places in historical context our work on the Multi-Domain Battle concept, a concept that takes joint integration to a higher level with an emphasis on maneuvering and projecting power across domains (i.e. land, sea, aerospace, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum) to create temporary windows of cross-domain superiority.     </p>
			<p>The development and proliferation of advanced capabilities including air defense systems; electronic warfare; unmanned aerial systems (UAS); long-range artillery, rockets, and missiles; offensive cyber; impede joint force freedom of action and maneuver.  Potential enemies employ sophisticated ground-based systems to rupture the joint force's ability to fight as an integrated team.  Russia, for example, established air supremacy over Ukraine from the ground. China built and then weaponized islands in the South China Sea to project power outward from land into maritime and aerospace domains.  These developments highlight the urgent need for a new concept to gain access to and operate in contested and highly competitive environments.   This is not a new problem, however.  Military history can help us develop the framework for Multi-Domain Battle that aims to defeat enemies that possess dense, complex anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) capabilities.  This week's readings (used previously), <a href="ProfessionalReadings?articleSeries=105"> "The Vicksburg Campaign: Unvexing the Father of Waters," </a> by Terry Winschel and select chapters from General Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs offer a historical perspective on how Army forces, operating as part of joint teams, can defeat enemy forces that possess sophisticated A2/AD capabilities and restore joint force freedom of maneuver.</p>
			<p>Winschel describes how Vicksburg was considered the "Gibraltar of the West" after Confederate forces spent two years fortifying the city.  Cannons along its bluff controlled the broad Mississippi River below, holding off Union gunboats and protecting the flow of logistics from Texas and Louisiana to Confederate forces in the East.  Strong land defenses consisting of nine major forts with connecting trenches and a 30,000 man Confederate Army under General John Pemberton guaranteed that an attack on Vicksburg would be a long, costly operation.  Vicksburg was a strategic objective for both sides.  Confederate capabilities prevented movement up and down the Mississippi River and protected the sole rail link between the east and western halves of the Confederacy. </p>
			<p>After independent attempts of land and maritime forces failed to capture Vicksburg, Major General U.S. Grant and Rear Admiral David Porter agreed, "If Vicksburg were to fall, it would be at the hands of a combined land and naval effort."  Chapters XXXII and XXXIII, of Grant's memoirs describe his operational approach to capture Vicksburg.  Grant maneuvered his army south down the west bank of the Mississippi as Porter ran his transports and river ironclads south past Vicksburg.  Naval and land forces joined back up at Grand Gulf to attempt a river crossing.  Naval fires destroyed Confederate positions as river transports ferried 20,000 Union soldiers across the Mississippi. Grant's forces then moved 200 miles over 17 days, first to the east to isolate Vicksburg by destroying supplies and defeating Confederate forces at Jackson, Mississippi, then moving back to the west to attack Vicksburg itself.  By the end of May, using an envelopment to cut off their lines of communication, Grant negated the Confederacy's denial capabilities and completed an encirclement of the city.  Surrounded and with dwindling supplies, the Vicksburg Garrison surrendered on 4 July 1863. Grant and Porter demonstrated that, although technology is important, imaginative, determined, and courageous leadership is always vital winning in battle.</p>
			<p>This week's readings also highlights the importance of expeditionary maneuver and Joint Combined Arms Operations to defeat enemies in highly contested environments. Expeditionary maneuver is the rapid deployment of task organized combined arms forces able to transition quickly and conduct operations of sufficient scale and ample duration to achieve strategic objectives. Enabled by expeditionary maneuver, Joint Combined Arms Operations are an extension of the concept of combined arms from two or more arms or elements of one service to include the application of joint, inter-organizational, and multinational capabilities.  Union forces would have been reduced to continued inconclusive artillery duels between Confederate defenses and Union gunboats without ground forces to cut off Confederate lines of communications. Land forces, enabled by naval gunfire and transport proved to be decisive to encircling Vicksburg and compelling the enemy to surrender.</p>
			<p>Expeditionary Maneuver and Joint Combined Arms Operations are as relevant today as in 1863.  Operating dispersed, mobile combined arms teams are able to concentrate rapidly to isolate the enemy, attack critical enemy assets, and seize upon fleeting opportunities. Forces conduct continuous reconnaissance and security operations to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative over the enemy while protecting the force against dangers. During Joint Combined Arms Operations Army forces maneuver and project power across all domains to ensure joint force freedom of action and deny the enemy the ability to operate freely across those domains. Army leaders synchronize the efforts of multiple partners across multiple domains to ensure unity of effort.</p>
			<p>The joint force is developing a new concept, Multi-Domain Battle, to describe future Joint Combined Arms operations. Multi-Domain Battle evolves combined arms methodology to include not only those capabilities of the physical domains, but also greater emphasis on space, cyberspace, and other contested areas such as the electro-magnetic spectrum, the information environment, and the cognitive dimension of warfare.  Combined arms integrates capabilities in such a way that to counteract one, the adversary must become more vulnerable to another. Multi-domain combined arms provides commanders numerous options for executing simultaneous and sequential operations using surprise and speed of action to present multiple dilemmas to an adversary.  Emphasis is on gaining physical and psychological advantages, exerting influence and establishing control over the multi-domain operational environment.  In the future, Joint Forces conducting Multi-Domain Battle will achieve cross-domain synergy across the land, maritime, aerospace, and cyber-electromagnetic domains in ways that are analogous to Admiral Porter's and General Grant's conduct of Multi-Domain Battle at Vicksburg.  </p>

			<p>Nothing says Merry Christmas like the ARCIC weekly reading</p>
			<p>When thinking about the problem of future war, Army leaders must
make a special effort to think in time and connect historical knowledge to
contemporary problems. While understanding the potential pitfalls of
reasoning by historical analogy, Army leaders need history to help place
contemporary problems in context. Over the past seven decades, U.S. land
forces have had a fundamental role in deterring great power conflict.
Deterrence in Europe during the Cold War depended, in large measure, on the
synergistic effect of a globally responsive and forward positioned joint
force - to include land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale to
deny enemy objectives. 	Although air and naval power contribute
indispensable capabilities to the Joint Force, stand-off and offshore
military capabilities seek to deter adversaries through the threat of
punishment. Land forces possess capabilities essential to deterrence by
denial - convincing an adversary that he cannot accomplish objectives
through force at an acceptable cost. Moreover, land forces communicate
intent unambiguously. Forward positioned land forces are the most credible
signal of U.S. commitment to a nation or region. 
</p>
			<p>In "Landpower and American Credibility," Michael Allen Hunzeker and
Alexander Lanoszka describe the value of forward positioned and capable land
forces to U.S. national security. Their essay is consistent with the work of
Thomas Schelling (who died last week) in the 1970s: to deter an enemy means
persuading him that he cannot accomplish his objectives. Forward, physical
presence of capable, credible forces conveys national commitment and intent.
Physical presence also assures allies, improves interoperability, and
enables contextual understanding of the operational environment. 
</p>
			<p>Consistent with Thomas Schelling, Hunzeker and Lanoszka argue that
effective deterrence depends on the ability to fight and win if war does
occur. Because land forces have the attributes of survivability, staying
power, and a psychological effect on adversaries, they are essential to the
Joint Force's ability to deter. And, potential enemies know that land forces
can hold and control territory and impose high costs. The authors conclude
with three implications for the Army and the Joint Force. First, the United
States must maintain capacity in land forces to conduct operations of
sufficient scale and ample duration to both deter and, if necessary, win.
Second, forward presence is essential because allies are hard to reassure
"on the cheap." Finally, the US Army should develop concepts and conduct
experimentation ".in the areas of forcible entry from air, space, and sea,
distributed land operations."
</p>
			<p>The absence of sufficient U.S. land forces increases an adversary's
willingness to try for a fait accompli before U.S. forces can be brought to
bear. History supports their argument. In 1947, Secretary of Defense James
Forrestal complained about the "drain upon Army resources in the form of
occupation troops" and that the occupation in Korea was a "source of
unceasing complaint from parents of the enlisted men who were unhappy,
dissatisfied and bored." As we now know, the result of undervaluing the
effect of forward positioned US combat formations from in South Korea set
conditions for the North Korean invasion in June 1950 and a costly war. And,
as we have learned from the reduction of U.S. land forces from Europe after
Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008, it is far more difficult to restore a
forward based deterrent once it has been dismantled. Yet, today there are
some who argue for 'off-shore balancing' or 'deterrence from afar.'
</p>
			<p>Recent events in Europe and the Korean Peninsula highlight the
continuing need for forward positioned land forces. Some have argued that
risk to national security is increasingly associated with an Army that may
lack the capacity, be insufficiently modernized, and out of position to
deter determined and increasingly aggressive adversaries. As the former
Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Breedlove, observed in a recent
Foreign Affairs article, deterrence requires both forward positioned capable
forces and the ability to reinforce those forces rapidly in times of crisis.

			<p>“Modernization is not solely the buying of new and more technically advanced equipment to be issued to the force. Rather, modernization begins with doctrine—concepts about how the Army should conduct its business. These concepts lead in turn to new tactical schemes for battle fighting, new equipment developments, new organizations in which equipment and tactics are combined, and revised training—the cement that bonds tactics, organizations, equipment, and soldiers into successful battle teams. If that training is successful, readiness is the result. If the whole system succeeds, preparedness is the outcome and deterrence is the perceived product.”</p>

			<p>Team</p>		
			<p>A recurring theme in our nation’s history is that during periods between major conflicts, the Army experiences strategic uncertainty accompanied by significant decreases in resources. These conditions are often due to flawed assumptions about future war that undervalue the need for ready land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and for ample duration to deter conflict and accomplish missions in wartime. And because those flawed assumptions are often implicit, risk associated with land forces that lack the readiness, capacity, or range of capabilities to secure the nation goes unaccounted.  Army leaders understand that, in our democracy, we get the Army that the American people are willing to pay for; it is our job to provide the best force we can with the resources we are allocated.  Army leaders must also be prepared to explain to civilian leaders and fellow citizens how the Army maintains readiness for today while modernizing to ensure readiness for tomorrow.  This week’s reading provides Army leaders a historical perspective on how our Army has recovered from wars and prepared for the next conflict, often under severe resource constraints.</p>
			<p>In “The US Army’s Postwar Recoveries,” Dr. Brian McAllister Linn, author of the recently-published book Elvis' Army, argues that increased strategic commitments, insufficient resources, and conflicting priorities have complicated postwar recovery processes for the US Army.  Personnel turbulence associated the discharge of experienced leaders and soldiers, tensions between policymakers and Army leadership, and inadequate training typified Army post-conflict recovery. Problems associated with the Army’s postwar recoveries after the Civil War, WWI, WWII, and Vietnam reveals “the real danger of falling for a comfortable vision of war" and risk that "the Army will invest its meager resources in missions that prove irrelevant to the future requirements of the United States.”  To limit turbulence associated with decreased resources and increased commitments, Army leaders need to “Have a clear-eyed, realistic appraisal of future needs.” </p>
			<p>Linn's observation is consistent with General Don Starry’s reflection on Army modernization in the 1970s based on “a logical sequence of things that go together. The equipment goes with the doctrine, the organization goes with the equipment and doctrine, the training goes with all that. It all made sense as a coherent whole.” To develop a clear-eyed view and a realistic appraisal, today's Army thinks clearly about future armed conflict; learns in a focused, sustained and collaborative manner; analyzes what it learns to identify capability gaps and prioritize potential solutions to overmatch future enemies; and implements those solutions to ensure the Joint Force’s ability to win.</p>
			<p>To develop a sound conceptual description of how the force will fight and win, leaders consider threats, enemies, and adversaries; anticipated missions; emerging technologies; and historical observations and lessons learned.  The Army learns in a focused, sustained, and collaborative manner under the framework of Army Warfighting Challenges and through Force 2025 Maneuvers.  AWFCs are enduring questions that help integrate force modernization efforts and allow Soldiers, leaders, and units to inform future force development.  Force 2025 Maneuvers encompass the intellectual and physical activities that help leaders learn and develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges.  The Army analyzes what it learns to define high risk problems, develop solutions and prioritize efforts.  Learning events such as experiments, wargames, and the Army Warfighting Assessment ensure sound investments in future capabilities.  Army leaders prioritize efforts and investments in the near- (present-2020), mid- (2020-2030), and far- (2030-2050) terms.  The Army implements solutions and delivers new capabilities to improve the combat effectiveness of the current and future force.  </p>
			<p>Recognizing that today’s Army is a more challenging position because it is not in a post-war period, Army leaders must, nonetheless, accept Dr. Linn’s charge to learn from our institutional history.  The foundation of our Army’s strength has always been and will remain Soldiers and teams that possess the capabilities and confidence to overmatch the enemy and win in land combat.  Everything we do in training, leading, manning, equipping, and building the future force aims to optimize Soldiers and foundational tactical units for warfighting.  And we must continue to strengthen the all-volunteer force through attracting new American citizen-volunteers to serve, challenging Soldiers to learn and grow as individuals and teams, and developing leaders who are expert in professional knowledge.</p>

			<p>Team</p>		
			<p>The recently published ADP 3-0 Operations discusses the six principles of unified land operations that when integrated properly, allow Army leaders to achieve operational and strategic success: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mission Command </li>
				<li>Develop the Situation Through Action</li>
				<li>Combined Arms</li>
				<li>Adherence to Law of War</li>
				<li>Establish and Maintain Security</li>
				<li>Create Multiple Dilemmas for the Enemy</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This week’s reading focuses on mission command.  Mission command is the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders to enable disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent. Mission command is also a warfighting function; comprised of related tasks and systems that enable commanders to balance to integrate the other warfighting functions under sound concepts of operation.  This week’s reading provides an example of how Army forces apply the principle of mission command to achieve operational objectives.</p>	
			<p>In "An Exercise in Mission Command: The Panther Brigade in Operation Inherent Resolve", authors COL Curtis Buzzard, LTC John White, and MAJ Jared Ferguson describe the brigade’s approach to an Advise and Assist mission in Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq.  This article reminds us that Army forces shape security environments while operating as part of Joint, inter-organizational, and multinational teams.  The authors describe an approach to mission command that emphasized innovative methods and talent management.    The authors emphasize the following:</p>	
			<ul>
				<liTalent management is more critical in situations where personnel limitations exist due to operational or political reasons (e.g. force caps that do not permit deployment of full teams).</li>
				<li>Sharing information with coalition and joint partners remains is difficult due to classification, language, classification, and communication systems.</li>
				<li>Situational awareness includes understanding of regional and partner nations' political and social dynamics that effect the mission and partner unit will.</li>
			
			</ul>	
			<p>To manage talent, under personnel constraints associated with the force cap, the brigade deployed critical capabilities (e.g. engineering, sustainment, and intelligence) to Kuwait, and brought them forward to Iraq temporarily to support the forward deployed Advise and Assist teams.  To mitigate the information sharing problem the brigade employed expeditionary digital liaison teams consisting of intelligence, signal, and interpreter support. </p>	
			<p>And to maintain situational understanding, the brigade’s leadership learned about social, political, tribal, and cultural dynamics and assessed how those dynamics effected the mission.  Understanding ethnic and sectarian competition and associated political alliances allowed advisors to identify why some Iraqi Army leaders were more effective than others.  While the unit focused its efforts on cooperative and persuasive influence techniques, it often faced adversaries that sought to undermine the mission in pursuit of their interests. The authors observe that effective mission command required leaders to understand social interactions between the US, coalition, and Iraqi counterparts.</p>	
			<p>The experience of the Panther brigade in Iraq highlights how Army leaders must use innovative solutions address complex problems.  This week’s article reinforces ideas important to the Army's next month's Unified Quest (UQ) Human Performance Seminar, 12-16 Dec.  The purpose is to provide the Chief of Staff of the Army a refined understanding of the required characteristics/attributes of Soldiers, leaders, and teams to win in a future war.  Seminar participants will examine attributes of future Soldiers and teams through the lenses of Multi-Domain Battle, Army Warfighting Challenges, and the Army Functional Concept for Movement and Maneuver. The seminar results will inform a revision of the Army Human Dimension Strategy. 
			For more information on the UQ Human Performance Seminar, contact <a href="mailto:glenn.a.hodges.mil@mail.mil"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> LTC Glenn Hodges</a> at 757-501-6403.</p>	
			<p>The Army's draft Movement and Maneuver functional concept recognizes the need for commanders to realize mission command as a required capability for dispersed operations in complex, lethal, and degraded environments.  The potential for enemies to degrade communications requires commanders to "realize" the Army’s mission command philosophy. Degraded conditions require commanders to empower subordinates to take initiative consistent with the commander’s intent. Commanders must determine the extent to which they centralize or decentralize authority based upon their understanding of the situation, their concept for accomplishing the mission, the mutual trust and confidence shared with subordinates, and the need to prioritize capabilities to accomplish the mission. Realizing mission command enables competent subordinate commanders who are at the point of decision and appreciate local dynamics that effect the mission.

			<p>Anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict.  Shifts in the geopolitical landscape caused by competition for power and resources influence the character of armed conflict. These shifts, and violence associated with them, occur more rapidly than in the past due to advances in technology, the proliferation of information, and the associated increased momentum of human interaction.  Coping with a turbulent and dangerous environment requires strategic vision. Strategy should account for particular threats and recognize that hostile actors do not operate in isolation from one another. Enemies and adversaries calibrate their actions. They watch and assess American actions and responses across the globe. Securing our nation from those who would harm our citizens or threaten vital interests requires an integrated grand strategy that drives the purposeful employment of all instruments of power – diplomatic, military, informational, economic, intelligence, and law enforcement.  This week’s reading examines how the Army develops and employs talent to develop strategic leaders who can contribute meaningfully at the strategic level.</p>
			<p>In “The Area under the Curve: Developing Strategic Leaders to Win in a Complex World,” Colonels Valery Keaveny Jr. and Michael Fenzel use examples of successful strategic leadership to illuminate the experiences and education that develop future strategic leaders.  The authors argue that all officers need core capabilities of character, resilience, commitment to self-development, tactical and operational mastery, and, most importantly, intellectual agility.  The authors examine the careers of Generals George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, Norman Schwarzkopf, and Colin Powell, describing key educational and operational experiences that prepared them for strategic leadership. In addition to operational command and staff assignments, the officers had broadening assignments that helped them develop strategic competencies.  Broadening assignments in academia, as instructors, and in interagency positions expanded leaders’ ability to develop strategy, organize to implement that strategy, and communicate with civilian, joint, and multi-national partners.  Keaveny and Fenzel recommend how the Army might develop strategic competencies earlier in an officer’s career.</p>


			<p>Keaveny and Fenzel’s article provides examples of how to broaden tactical leaders and grow strategic leaders.  They observe that self-development is critical to maturing officers into strategic leaders, observing that “What is closest to a panacea is the time that our young military leaders are allotted and carve out to read, reflect, think, write, and clarify their professional thinking on larger and more complex geopolitical issues.”  Consider the following interdisciplinary approach to self-development:</p>
			<div>- History to think in time and reason by historical analogy </div>
		  	<div>- Security studies to better understand geopolitical trends and essential elements of effective strategy   </div>
		    <div>- Language, geography, and area studies to understand enemies </div>
			<div>- Sociology and political science to understand civil-military relations in our society and to help maintain the connection between our military and those in whose name we serve. </div>
			<div>- Psychology to understand the cognitive pitfalls that can lead to blunders and strategic failures.  </div>
			<div>- Philosophy, theology, and law to develop empathy and solidify a commitment to moral and ethical conduct in war consistent with our values.  </div>
			<div>- Leadership to understand how to develop and execute strategies as well as provide the purpose, direction, and motivation necessary to maintain military morale and popular will in war.  </div>

			<blockquote>
			<p>“Army forces remain the preeminent fighting force in the land domain. However, Army forces conduct multi-domain battle, as part of a joint force.... Army forces deter adversaries, restrict enemy freedom of action, and ensure freedom of maneuver and action in multiple domains for the joint force commander.”</p>
			<footer>ADP 3-0, November 2016</footer>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>Team</p>		
			<p>The recently published ADP 3-0 emphasizes the observation in the Army Operating Concept that “American military power is joint power.” Complementary joint force capabilities with sufficient capacity are essential to deter war as well as to respond to and resolve crises.   The long-range strike capabilities of our Air Force and Navy are vitally important to joint operations as is the ability to achieve maritime and air superiority. Without sufficient naval and air force capability and capacity US ground forces are vulnerable to enemy action, assuming that they could even deploy to an area of operation.  Today’s operating environment requires the Joint Force to compete for superiority across the air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains.  Potential enemies have developed counters to US Joint Force strengths to limit freedom of action in the maritime, aerospace, and cyberspace domains as well as the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). This week’s professional reading reinforces the need for integrated joint operations to counter increasingly capable enemies and adversaries.</p>
			<p>In “US Naval Forces Before and Beyond Battle” the Under Secretary of the Navy, Dr. Janine Davidson, identifies requirements for the U.S. Navy to win in the contested future environment.   She argues that the Navy must define how it operates in environments of “multi-domain competition and multi-domain warfare, including deterrence.”    She observes that planning and force sizing must consider operations across all regions and domains.  Secretary Davidson identifies four important roles for Navy forces in the future:</p>
			<p>
				<div>1. Deterrence </div>
				<div>2. Power Projection </div>
				<div>3. Sea Control </div>
				<div>4. Strategic Sealift</div>			
			</p>
			<p>Naval forces are suited for cross-domain operations because of the ability to operate independent of land bases, air and missile capabilities, and the ability to maneuver long distances across water to gain positional advantage.  </p>
			<p>As we think about Army contributions to Joint synergy, we might consider how Secretary Davidson’s roles for Navy forces apply to land forces.</p>
			<p>1.  Deterrence: Land forces possess capabilities essential to deterrence by denial - convincing an adversary that he cannot accomplish objectives through force at an acceptable cost.  Moreover, land forces communicate intent unambiguously.  Forward positioned land forces are the most credible signal of U.S. commitment to a nation or region. Forward positioned and rotational land forces demonstrate provide foundational capabilities to the Joint Force such as communications, intelligence, rotary wing aviation, missile defense, logistics, and engineering. Those capabilities combined with strategic airlift and sealift and prepositioned equipment on land or afloat ensure Army forces are prepared to deter adversaries; respond rapidly to crises; and conduct expeditionary maneuver against enemy forces that threaten U.S. interests.</p>
			<p>2. Power Projection: Army forces integrate the efforts of multiple partners. For example, Army headquarters provide joint, interorganizational, and multinational teams with the ability to plan, execute, and assess operations in complex environments. Army forces support partners with critical capabilities such as situational understanding, security, missile defense, communications, engineering, and logistics. Army forces ensure that combatant commanders possess the ability to scale-up and sustain Joint Forces rapidly through forward positioning, theater infrastructure capabilities, and the use of prepositioned equipment and supplies.</p>
			<p>3.  Sea Control: The Army sets the theater. Joint forces depend on the Army to provide essential capabilities to maintain the theater structure and Joint Force freedom of action. Future Army forces will possess additional offensive capabilities to project power from land into air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.</p>
			<p>4.  Strategic Sealift: Army sustainment units integrate efforts with the Joint Force to ensure unimpeded sustainment flows across the land, air, and maritime domains. These units provide supplies and services to the point of need to joint, Army, and multinational forces as well as interorganizational partners to ensure freedom of movement and action.  Sea control and strategic sealift is vitally important to our nation, Joint Force, and Army operations.  As Sir Julian Corbett, the great British naval historian observed, “Since men live on the land and not upon the sea, great issues between nations at war have always been decided – except in the rarest cases – either by what your army can do against your enemy’s territory and national life, or else by fear of what the fleet makes possible for your army to do.”  The ability of our Navy to get our nation's land forces (i.e. Army, USMC, SOF) to the fight must not be taken for granted.</p>
			<p>Secretary Davidson’s reminds Army leaders of the need to integrate joint capabilities.  Army leaders must understand capabilities and limitations of each service to ensure complementary effects.  As an extension of the principle of combined arms, each service depends on the strengths of one to compensate for the limitations of another.  When fighting against determined and capable enemies, integrated complementary capabilities allows joint teams to remain resilient, pose multiple dilemmas to the enemy, and create multiple options for the combatant commander.  </p>
			<p>As Secretary Davidson said at AUSA this October, for the last fourteen years “we have not had to ever think about what the fight might look like without air superiority or fires from the sea.” To that end, the Army is developing the concept of Multi-Domain Battle to ensure that the Army can fight across domains and open windows of domain superiority to enable the joint force in Joint Combined Arms Maneuver.

			<p>Team</p>		
			<p>A recent 60 Minutes report by Ms. Lara Logan on the Iraqi Army’s offensive to retake Mosul illuminates many of the problems of contemporary warfare.  Iraqi forces, enabled by US combat advisors, are employing combat vehicles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and maneuvering to positions of advantage in close combat against ISIS forces in dense urban terrain.   The enemy has established an area defense in depth that employs fortified positions, complex obstacle belts, snipers, UAS, indirect fires, and local counter-attacks.  The presence of non-combatants complicates an already difficult problem set.  The enemy continues to commit mass murder of civilians while using them as human shields.  
			 <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-battle-for-mosul-iraq-lara-logan/" target="_blank">(Watch Logan’s compelling report)</a></p>	
			<p>Despite difficulties in the long campaign against ISIS, Iraqi, Kurdish, and Turkish forces in Northern Iraq and Syria are gaining momentum.  Even after ISIS is denied control of territory and populations, however, the terrorist threat is not going away. Because we and our allies know that battlegrounds overseas are inexorably connected to our own security, we must understand how ISIS's proto-state allowed that organization to generate not only a humanitarian catastrophe of colossal scale, but also a multi-generational security problem that demands a sustained response from all civilized people.</p>	
			
			<p>In “Rising Threat: The Islamic State’s Militarization of Children” authors Dr. Sebastian L. Gorka, Katharine C. Gorka, and Claire Herzog examine the chilling phenomenon systematized child abuse by terrorist organizations like ISIS.  ISIS and other terrorist organizations including those in safe havens from northeastern Nigeria to Pakistan cynically use a perverted interpretation of religion to perpetuate ignorance, incite hatred, and justify horrific cruelty against innocents.  The authors summarize the increasing abuse of child soldiers over the past twenty-five years, mainly in Africa and the Middle East where a “cult of martyrdom” has made their use as soldiers and suicide bombers more prevalent.  ISIS like Al Qaeda in Iraq before them, went further.  ISIS conducts recruitment, training, brainwashing, and employment of children on an industrial scale.  Rape and sexual abuse often compounds their inhumane treatment.  As the authors point out ISIS does not use children merely as “cannon fodder,” children are indoctrinated and trained in well-organized ISIS “schools.”  And ISIS has extended its targeting of vulnerable youth seeking identity and affirmation beyond the borders of Iraq and Syria.  The organization runs sophisticated recruiting and brainwashing networks such as the one recently disrupted in Germany

			<p> ISIS’s systematic child abuse is an example of how terrorist groups use a broad range of tools to control populations and achieve their goals.   Those tools include sophisticated propaganda campaigns that excite historical grievances among ethic or sectarian groups, pit communities against each other, and incite a cycle of violence.   Insurgent, terrorist, and criminal organizations then portray themselves as patrons or protectors of parties to these conflicts to gain control of territory, economies, and populations.  They solidify control through coercion and intimidation while generating revenue, marshalling additional resources to extend their power and secure more territory.</p>	
			<p>Despite recent military successes against ISIS in Iraq and around Raqqah in Syria, the terrorist organization’s ability to establish and maintain control of territory and populations for two years has already generated a multi-generational threat to international security.  It was in Pakistani safe havens that the ‘alumni’ from the resistance to Soviet occupation in Afghanistan and the Afghan Civil War learned the skills and were indoctrinated with the ideology that they later applied to transnational terrorism under Al Qaeda.  The threat from ISIS alumni is already orders of magnitude larger.  This difficult situation highlights lessons that apply to this “Long War” against trans-national terrorist organizations.  Those include:</p>	
						
			<p>-While raids and long range strikes against terrorist organizations remain an important capability, land forces that possess the will, capacity, and range of capabilities to defeat determined enemies, secure terrain, and protect populations are essential to winning.</p>	
			<p>-As the new ADP 3-0 observes, establishing security and the consolidation of gains is “an integral part of winning armed conflict and achieving success across the range of military operations, and it is essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies and adversaries.” (page 6) 
			<a href="../App_Documents/LPD/ADP-3-0.pdf" target="_blank">Go to this link</a> to see the full publication:  </p>	
			
			<p>-There are no short term solutions to long term problems.  It will take concerted effort over years to reverse the damage ISIS has done to youth in the region and beyond.  Wars do not end when we decide to withdraw.  </p>	
			<p>-War is fundamentally human. Army forces must fight on the battlegrounds of perception and education as well as physical battlegrounds.  The most important long term effort might be education.</p>	
			<p>-When faced with brutal enemies we must retain our moral character despite the depravity of our enemies.   To inoculate soldiers and units against moral and ethical break downs, leaders should make a concerted effort in applied ethics, realistic training, education about culture and history of the people among whom wars are fought, and leadership to set the example, keep soldiers informed, and manage combat stress.

			<p>“Multi-Domain Battle:  Cross-domain operations that create temporary windows of superiority across multiple domains, and allow Joint Forces to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative.”</p>	
			
			<p>Team</p>
			<p>On 23 August 2016, Turkey invaded Islamic State-controlled northern Syria alongside Free Syrian Army (FSA) elements against the Islamic State and Kurdish rebel groups in an operation named Operation Euphrates Shield (OES).  Not only does the operation demonstrate the essential contributions of land power to accomplishment of strategic objectives, it also highlights tactical lessons important to the conduct of multi-domain battle and joint combined arms maneuver.  As the only NATO member conducting counter-ISIL operations with conventional combined arms formations to include large numbers of combat vehicles, Turkey’s ground forces seized and held terrain in Syria previously occupied by the Islamic State.  As a result, they disrupted ISIL’s ability to infiltrate across the Turkish border to conduct attacks.  </p>	
			<p>In “Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield:  An Exemplar of Joint Combined Arms Maneuver,” Jeff Jager describes Turkey’s use of land power to control terrain and achieve strategic objectives. Jager uses the following tenets from the Army Operating Concept (AOC) to analyze Turkish Army execution of JCAM and multi-domain battle:</p>	
			<ul>
				<li>Initiative</li>
				<li>Simultaneity</li>
				<li>Endurance</li>
				<li>Lethality</li>
				<li>Mobility</li>		
		
			</ul>	
			<p>Operations consistent with those tenets allowed Turkish forces to dictate the terms of operations.  They won multiple engagements quickly while maneuvering into positions of advantage.  Turkish success in seizing large areas from ISIL highlighted the importance of "mastery of armor small unit tactics and the imperative to upgrade armor platforms as threats evolve.”  Turkey is improving unit training and beginning production of its new main battle tank, the Altay in 2018.  </p>	
			<p>Operation Euphrates Shield demonstrates need for modernized combat vehicles to enable JCAM and multi-domain battle.  To overcome capabilities like the ATGMs encountered in Syria, combat vehicles need advanced protection. The Army is pursuing a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) near-term acquisition strategy to procure active protection systems for combat vehicles.  What the Army learns from soft- and hard-kill demonstrations will inform requirements for the developmental Vehicle Protection Suite (VPS).  And the US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is working on a Modular Active Protection System framework strategy to provide a ‘kittable’ APS package for combat vehicles.        </p>	
			<p>Based on improved adversary capabilities, the Army accelerated planned lethality upgrades for the Stryker ICV and initiated procurement of 30mm cannons and Remote Weapon Station – Javelin missile mounts for Strykers in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Germany.  Although lethality and protection upgrades to existing platforms are critical, the Army must also move forward on the next generation of combat vehicles.  </p>	
			<p>Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) is a funded Army program that will provide Infantry Brigade Combat Team with a protected, mobile, precision direct fires to enable freedom of maneuver of movement and action in close contact with the enemy in urban and restrictive terrain.  MPF will give IBCTs the ability to defeat enemy positions identified by Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV) - equipped scouts or dismounted infantry squads.  The MPF combat vehicle will defeat enemy prepared positions and destroy like enemy armored vehicles.  MPF and LRV are urgent requirements to address extremely high risk capability gaps.  Emphasis on procurement of those capabilities is on rapid procurement of vehicles that integrate mature technologies.  The Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) will integrate emerging technologies to ensure close combat overmatch across the range of military operations.   NGCV Early Synthetic Prototyping (ESP) and demonstration prototyping will inform requirements and allow the Army and industry partners to integrate new technologies under innovative engineering concepts.  Those technologies include passive and reactive protection, combat vehicle lightweighting, blast protection technologies, vehicle camouflage, decoy and deception, hit avoidance, improved target acquisition, active protection, and power and energy to improve performance and reduce logistics demand.</p>	
			<p>This week’s readings remind us that Army combined arms formations must be prepared to fight and win on future battlefields.  For Armored Brigade Combat Teams near term priorities include not only improvements in combat vehicles, but also improvements in organization.  Those include the restoration of two mechanized infantry companies, the addition of a tank company (to retain a tank company in the cavalry squadron and return to balanced combined arms battalions) and cavalry squadron capacity (6x36 scout platoons and 3 platoons per troop).  TRADOC is also working on other capabilities might be restored or decentralized to brigade level.  These include terrestrial intelligence collection, EW, air defense, aviation, and long range precision fires.  </p>

			<p>Understanding trends in threats, the operating environment, and technology is important to ensuring that future Army forces are prepared to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win in future war.  Anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict.  Changes based on technological, new strategic guidance, revised joint operating concepts, and emerging security problems require the U.S. Army to innovate and stay ahead of change.</p>
			<p>In this week’s reading, “The Future Operating Environment 2050: Chaos, Complexity and Competition,” authors Kimberly Amerson and Spencer Meredith assess estimates of the future operating environment across the intelligence and defense communities.  They identify common trends relevant to future force development. They emphasize the following trends due to their disruptive potential:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Technological evolution in advanced applications, cyber, and communications capabilities </li>
			<li>Increased resource competition between and within states and regions</li>
			<li>Shifting demographics from immigration and migration and the expansion of megacities</li>
			<li>Diffusion of power due to technology, economic expansion, and advances in communications and manufacturing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Amerson and Meredith argue that these trends have blurred the lines between peace and war.  The future environment will be “characterized by complexity, chaos, and competition.”   The authors argue that while these trends will shift the character of future war, traditional US Army roles will remain vital to national security.  They argue that the Army must emphasize “whole-of-Army integration” because conventional and special operations will need to maneuver across all domains to maintain physical deterrence by denial as well as shape the security environment through engaging allies and neutrals.  </p>
			<p>Identifying trends helps us make a grounded projection into the future operating environment as the basis for future force development.  Because trends are rarely linear, however, we must guard against extending predictions too far into the future.  As Dr. Conrad Crane has observed, “Shaping an Army based on predictions too far in the future not only does not allow for course corrections responding to unexpected technologies or threat adaptation, but it also it risks building a force on the foundation of a hallucination.”</p>
			<p>Analysis of the present combined with an understanding of history permits confident predictions of the near future and allows military leaders, defense officials and industry to meet what Sir Michael Howard identified as the challenge to: “steer between the danger of repeating the errors of the past because he is ignorant that they have been made, and the danger of remaining bound by theories deduced from past history although changes in conditions have rendered these theories obsolete.”  </p>
			<p>Amerson and Meredith’s article introduces ideas important to the Army’s next week's Unified Quest (UQ) Character of Future War Seminar, 7-10 Nov.  The Character of Future War Seminar’s purpose is to provide the Chief of Staff of the Army a refined understanding of the future operational environment and its implications for future force development.  Additionally, the seminar will inform the development of the Multi-Domain Battle concept and refine a draft list of attributes and capabilities required to fight and win in the 2030 - 2050 timeframe. 

</p>

			<p> The Army Operating Concept highlights a characteristic of the future operating environment that will be of increasing importance to Army operations: </p>
			<p>“The speed at which information diffuses globally through multiple means increases the velocity, momentum, and degree of interaction among people. The diffusion of information via the Internet and social media amplifies and accelerates interaction between people, governments, militaries, and threats. Access to information allows organizations to mobilize people and resources locally, regionally, and globally. Disinformation and propaganda drive violence in support of political objectives. The compression of events in time requires forces capable of responding rapidly in sufficient scale to seize the initiative, control the narrative, and consolidate order.” </p>
			<p>This is happening today.  State and non-state actors conduct operations in the cyber domain to inform and influence adversaries, neutrals, and supporters.  Global and regional competitors as well as non-state actors invest in capabilities to protect their access and disrupt or deny access to others. Enemies and adversaries operate beyond physical battlegrounds and employ sophisticated strategies that integrate propaganda, disinformation, political subversion, cyber-attacks, and criminal activity.  </p>
			<p>This week’s professional reading “War Goes Viral: How Social Media is Being Weaponized Across the World” by Emerson T. Brooking and P.W. Singer describe the growth of social media in conflict and the many ways competitors use it.  The authors compare the advent of the telegraph with the rise of the Internet and the following wave of social media.  Many believed that the telegraph would end conflict through the free exchange of ideas between elites.  Instead, it became a tool to that enabled warfare and made information accessible across populations.  Elites lost control of information.  </p>
			<p>Today, the Internet and social media have increased dramatically the accessibility of information to 3.4 billion Internet users. And, like the telegraph, the Internet has enabled conflict rather than fostered peace. Targeted information and misinformation complements military operations in the physical domain. Brooking and Singer describe how social media is used to undermine enemy resolve: distort the truth, create mistrust in systems of government, and sow doubt within the opponent’s military.  For example, ISIS’s social media machine broadcasted the group’s march on Mosul to weaken the Iraqi military’s will and resolve.  Meanwhile, narratives mobilize supporters and impel them to act.   And social media extends an organization’s reach across the world.  Today's threat extends beyond ISIS and other transnational terrorist organizations.  Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and others possess significant social media capabilities and use them.  Every conflict today entails a social media component. That trend will continue with negative implications for international security.</p>
			<p>Because the Internet enables those who foster a perpetual state of mistrust, the likelihood of conflict is increasing.  Singer and Brooking predict a future “global battle of competing narratives.”  This is a dystopian future without facts with populations polarized by ideology and national allegiance.  </p>
			<p>Although the use of social media in war is new, the phenomenon highlights continuities in the nature of war as well as change in the character of warfare.  War remains a contest of wills.  As Clausewitz observed, winning in war means convincing the enemy that he has been defeated.  The “weaponization” of social media can also help bolster one’s own will.  As we think about the influence of social media in future war, we might view it through the tenet of Simultaneity from the Army Operating Concept:</p>
			<p>“Simultaneity is the execution of related and mutually supporting tasks at the same time across multiple locations and domains. Operating simultaneously across the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains allows Army forces to deliver multiple blows to the enemy while reassuring allies and influencing neutrals. The simultaneous application of joint and combined arms capabilities aims to overwhelm the enemy physically and psychologically. Simultaneity extends efforts beyond physical battlefields into other contested spaces such as public perception, political subversion, illicit financing, and criminality.”  </p>
			<p>Exploitation of social media in war could allow our Army to project power and deliver multiple simultaneous psychological blows that complement and magnify achievements on physical battlegrounds. Warfare today and in the future demands Army leaders who are able to synchronize efforts of multiple partners across multiple domains to ensure unity of effort and pose multiple dilemmas to enemies and adversaries.  To ensure Army leaders can do this, the Army conducted Unified Quest seminar “Fighting on the Battleground of Perception” at the United States Army War College Center for Strategic Leadership from 21 – 25 September 2015.  </p>

    The consolidation of gains is an integral part of armed conflict and remains essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies and adversaries.  Recent experiences in Iraq,
			Afghanistan, and Libya taught us that the need to consolidate gains is fundamental to campaign planning and execution.  For example, ISIL took advantage of communal conflict, weak governance,
			and the failure to consolidate military gains achieved in Iraq from 2007-2010.  In a previous professional reading,

     <a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/LPD/_archives?articleSeries=67" target="_self" >&quot;War and the Art of Governance&quot;</a>,
                                                                                                                               
			Dr. Nadia Schadlow made two key points about the consolidation of gains (her book on U.S. Army's role in the consolidation of gains is forthcoming from Georgetown University Press): </p>
			<p>- The US Army has repeatedly been directly responsible for reconstruction and consolidation efforts since the 1800s. </p>
<p>- Consolidation of military gains requires not only specialized Civil Affairs units, but also Army units of all types whose leaders and teams are prepared to execute tasks essential to consolidation.</p>
<p>This week's reading provides insights into how the US Army developed the doctrine for and organized, trained, and equipped units to execute wide area security missions, consolidate gains, and achieve sustainable political outcomes. </p>
<p>Kendall Gott's paper "Mobility, Vigilance, and Justice: The US Army Constabulary in Germany, 1946-1953," describes the formation of the US Army Constabulary after the defeat of Nazi Germany.  In October 1945, the US Army began the transition of security duties from combat divisions to a new force, the US Constabulary, made up of the 4th Armored Division and all seven cavalry groups.  The 32,000 man force was organized into three brigades of three regiments, each with three squadrons.  Each squadron had five cavalry troops equipped with jeeps and armored cars for mobility. Each squadron also maintained a light tank company for contingency operations (see pp. 11-13 for organization).  </p>
<p>MG Ernest Harmon, the brilliant commander of the 2d Armored Division during the war, assumed duties as the first commander of the US Constabulary.  His personal example and constant presence throughout the Constabulary's area of operations ensured that widely dispersed units and leaders knew and maintained high standards.  The Constabulary operated in patrols to conduct law and order operations, maintain border security, and assist German police and government organizations.  In 1948, units of the Constabulary were quickly reorganized and equipped to respond to the Berlin Crisis as conventional units.  Over time, the Constabulary shifted more and more responsibility for policing to the local German police forces and focused on the conventional mission of border security and control along the East German and Czechoslovakian borders. </p>
<p>The US Constabulary was successful in consolidating gains in Germany because of: </p>
<p>-  Flexible design that placed a premium on mobility and the ability to operate dispersed while also allowing units to be repurposed as a conventional force.</p>
<p>-  Decentralized operations consistent with the philosophy of mission command.</p>
<p>-  Assured long range communications through radio and telephone. </p>
<p>-  Training specific to the police-like duties Soldiers were to perform.</p>
<p>-  Equipment that provided mobility, protection, and firepower at platoon and troop levels. </p>
<p>As Dr Conrad Crane observed about the need for the Army to be prepared to consolidate gains in future armed conflict, "We have never been able to 'never do this again.'"  To ensure our forces are prepared, our Army must maintain the core competency of Wide Area Security through realistic training in the Decisive Training Environment.   Wide area security is the application of the elements of combat power to protect populations, forces, infrastructure, and activities to deny the enemy positions of advantage and to consolidate gains in order to retain the initiative.  Wide area security requires Army forces to conduct essential stability tasks such as establish civil security; security force assistance; establish civil control; restore essential services; support governance; and support economic and infrastructure development.  </p>
<p>
    Although the experience of the post-World War II Army in Germany was unique, that experience remains relevant today.
      Army forces and key partners today are critical to the consolidation of gains during Iraqi-led offensive operations in Ninewa Province as they are essential to ongoing security effort in Afghanistan.
      These and other conflicts have taught us that there are no short term solutions to long term problems.  For example, just last week, the 1st Squadron, 33rd Cavalry Regiment, "War Rakkasans,"
     deployed to Kosovo as the US contribution to NATO's KFOR mission, a mission that we have sustained since 1999.  Their commander, LTC Scott Virgil, noted "The mission will require soldiers that can be flexible, 
    adaptable and that can provide freedom of movement. 
    This is something that cavalrymen are always trained to do." (please see this article for more information on the 
    <a href="http://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/fort-campbell/2016/10/06/101st-airborne-squadron-marks-deployment-kosovo/91634358/" target="_blank"> War Rakkasans deployment:</a>).
  LTC Virgil, Dr Crane, and Dr Schadlow are correct: the Army will remain foundational to the Joint Force's ability to integrate the efforts of multiple partners and consolidation of gains so we can achieve sustainable outcomes consistent with our vital interests and worth of our Soldiers' sacrifices in war.

			<p>Fallacies about future war persist, in part, because of a tendency to define war as one might like it to be; the next war is portrayed as fundamentally different from all that have gone before it.  To protect against that dangerous tendency, Army professionals might pay particular attention to continuities in the nature of war. Lessons from recent and ongoing conflicts reinforce the need to balance the technological focus of Army modernization with a recognition of the limits of technology and an emphasis on the human, cultural, and political continuities of war. Nations and organizations in the future will fight for the same reasons that the Greek historian Thucydides identified 2,500 years ago: fear, honor, and interest. And every armed conflict exhibits some combination of violence, emotion, policy, chance, and risk.  All wars are interactive.  Future enemies will not be passive recipients of our military prowess; they will make every effort to avoid U.S. strengths, emulate advanced capabilities, and disrupt advantages. Enemies and adversaries will expand operations to other ‘battlegrounds’ such as those of perception, political subversion, and criminality.  Ultimately, war is and will remain a contest of wills.</p>
			<p>Although advances in technology influence the character of warfare, the effect of technologies on land are often not as great as in other domains due to geography, the interaction with adaptive enemies, the presence of noncombatants, and other complexities associated with war’s continuities.  This week’s reading cautions us against basing future force development on flawed assumptions that define future war as we might like it be.  Particularly dangerous are assumptions based on business analogies to war that fail to consider how continuities in the nature of war limits the value of those analogies.</p>
			<p>In “Is the Conduct of War a Business?”, Dr. Milan Vego examines the lure of applying operations research techniques and business models to military affairs.  During the Vietnam War, for example, the US military applied systems analysis and game theory to operations against North Vietnam.  The results were disappointing.  In the 1990s and 2000s, the assumption that information would become the most important source of power spawned the concept of “Network Centric Warfare,” a centerpiece of the orthodoxy of the "Revolution in Military Affairs."  The focus on technology and metrics confused military activity with progress in the wars of the 21st century, setting up the US military for many of the difficulties encountered in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
			<p>Vego acknowledges that business and warfare have similarities (in that both involve human factors, high risks, and rationality versus irrationality), but emphasizes the differences. Dr. Vego defines two critical terms: efficiency (avoiding the waste of time and resources) and effectiveness (achieving the enterprise’s objective).  Those who conflate efficiency with effectiveness overlook the purpose of war.  In war, effectiveness matters most; the risks are far higher than in business.  Indeed, a commander who tries to be efficient in war and loses has not been efficient at all.  </p>
			<p>Dr. Vego’s examination of business and the military helps us think clearly about the problem of future war.  His examples of how an overreliance on business models led the military astray warns us to be skeptical of concepts, technologies, or terminology that promise quick and easy victory.  We must not shrink from challenging flawed assumptions.  Some may be hesitant to do so because they fear being labeled as unimaginative.  If leaders appear insufficiently visionary they might risk losing the confidence of senior leaders. The best approach may be to aggressively pursue new technological capabilities while exposing implicit assumptions that often underpin flawed thinking about future war.  Visions of future war that emphasize discontinuity with past wars, such as the orthodoxy of the Revolution in Military Affairs in the 1990s, are based on assumptions to similar to these:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Complex political-military problems can be solved from stand-off range and a narrow range of advanced technologies.</li>
			<li>Deterrence results from long range capabilities that deliver “overwhelming firepower” rather than forward positioned and rotational joint forces able to assure partners and deny a potential aggressor’s objectives on the ground.</li>
			<li>Consolidation of gains and control of territory, populations, and resources are not inherent aspects of armed conflict.</li>
			<li>Ambiguous and sanitary “power projection,” rather than fighting under chaotic and uncertain conditions, is what the Joint Force does to respond to and resolves crises.</li>
			<li>Technology can substitute for capacity, especially capacity in ready land forces.</li>
			<li>Joint forces can rapidly regenerate when needed.</li>
			<li>Partners will be reliable, having both the capability and will to act in our as well as their own interests.</li>
			<li>Joint forces can “aggregate and disaggregate,” ad hoc, without losing combat effectiveness.</li>			
			</ol>
			<p>Fortunately, the Department of Defense and the Joint Force recognizes the tendency to envision future war as we might like it to be.  Emerging concepts and strategies consider continuities in the nature of war and changes in the character of armed conflict.  Last week leaders from the Department of Defense and the Joint Force spoke at a panel entitled “Multi-Domain Battle: Ensuring Joint Force Freedom of Action in Future War” during the Association of the United States Army's Annual Meeting and Exposition in Washington, D.C. Some key points that emerged during this discussion are:</p>
			<p>1)Forward Positioning and Deterrence by Denial – Forward positioning or rotation of forces overseas has long been essential to preventing conflict and shaping security environments. Forward positioned forces with maneuver and cross-domain fires capabilities can deny an adversary of its goals (i.e. critical maritime chokepoints and strategic waterways such as Baltic Sea, Straits of Hormuz, and East China Sea). A forward positioned force turns denied domains into contested domains.</p>
			<p>2) The Importance of Maneuver – Maneuver and fires are inseparable and complementary. They both provide a synergistic effect. Maneuver forces exploit windows of advantage to close with the enemy, overcome enemy countermeasures, compel outcomes, and consolidate gains.</p>
			<p>3) American Military Power is Joint Power – Trends in threats, the operating environment, and technology highlight the need for joint integration rather than interdependence while operating in joint, interorganizational, and multinational teams to present the enemy with multiple dilemmas across multiple domains and win in future war. </p>
			<p>4) Capacity Matters and Is More Important – Since the 1990s, capacity has been traded for capabilities to maintain dominance over adversaries with technology. Today we see a shift in U.S. comparative military advantages while capacity to conduct operations against a sophisticated enemy has diminished.</p>
			<p>5) Integration vs. Interdependence – The Joint Force must now integrate capabilities across multiple domains to create windows of superiority as no one domain can dominate. Joint Force operations across multiple domains, in partnership with other nations and organizations, present the enemy with multiple dilemmas and provides multiple options for the Joint Force Commander.  Integrated Joint Operations is the primary US differential advantage over potential enemies.</p>
			<p>6) Command and Control in the future must be Multi-Domain - The Joint Force requires horizontal and vertical integration between domains, functions, and services to effectively command and control in the future to allow commanders to make decisions in the increasingly demanding information environment.</p>
			<p>7) Consolidation of gains is an integral part of armed conflict.  </p>
			<p>8) Humans remain central to the problem of future war - Human-machine teaming, training for leaders for the future, and creating joint and multinational teams all deal with managing human capital. </p>
			<p>Please watch the panel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt0HzNbbSBk" target="_blank" onClick="ga('send', 'event', { eventCategory: 'Video',  eventAction: 'Play', eventLabel: 'Multi-Domain Battle Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt0HzNbbSBk', eventValue: 1});">Multi-Domain Battle: Ensuring Joint Force Freedom of Action in Future War</a>.</p>
			<p>What is certain about the future is that even the best efforts to predict the conditions of future war will prove inaccurate. As CSA General Mark Milley reminds us, what is important is to not be so far off the mark that visions of the future run counter to the very nature of war and render American forces unable to adapt to unforeseen challenges. </p>

			<p>In 1968, as a response to popular unrest, the Czechoslovakian government initiated a number of reforms that resulted in an increasing Western orientation.  In reaction to this “Prague Spring” the Soviet Union and some Warsaw Pact allies conducted a series of exercises from June to August to obscure the assembly of an invasion force along Czechoslovakia’s borders.  These culminated in an air defense exercise named SKYSHIELD from 11 to 20 August 1968 that concluded with the invasion of Czechoslovakia by 250,000 troops from the north, south, and east on the night of the 20th.  The Soviets and their allies quickly overran the country and restored authoritarian control over Czechoslovakia, ending the courageous effort to escape oppression.  The Soviets obscured their actions to facilitate the invasion and buy time to consolidate gains before NATO could respond.  Today, the Russians use information warfare in Ukraine and Syria as in a similar manner to obscure their actions and prevent and effective Western response.</p>
			<p>In “Putin’s Information Warfare in Ukraine: Soviet Origins of Russia’s Hybrid Warfare”, Maria Snegovaya observes that Russia’s “new” concepts and techniques of information warfare are actually those that Soviet leaders developed during the Cold War.  In particular, Russian information warfare in Ukraine is consistent with an old disinformation doctrine known as reflexive control, a doctrine that aims to influence a target’s perceptions to get that target to act consistent with Russian desires. </p>
			<p>The Russian military and its Soviet precursor refined the application of reflexive control across three decades.  At the tactical and operational levels, reflexive control is meant to deceive the enemy, influence the enemy’s decision-making processes, and to achieve surprise. At the strategic level, Russians and Soviets have used reflexive control to influence domestic and international politics.  </p>
			<p>Today, Russian information warfare uses tools available in the contemporary information environment (internet, social networks, etc.). Snegovaya exposes these and old Soviet practices that Russia has reinvigorated such as spreading disinformation through think tanks and foreign-language news outlets. The combination of new and old methods are meant to create ambiguity and hide aggression through the 4D approach: dismiss, distort, distract, and dismay.</p>
			<p>One Russian information warfare strength is unity of effort.  Russian information warfare uses modern information networks to enable coordination between the military and the whole of government, all of which take direction from Mr. Putin. Russian “information troops” are integral to campaign design and operations. This problem is not going away.  </p>
			<p>Russian theorists foresee an expansion of information warfare to include the destruction of enemy critical infrastructure through cyber attacks.  Yet, there are limitations to Russian information warfare. For example, disinformation campaigns degrade over time as contrary evidence becomes clear.  And many populations, such as in Ukraine, are unsympathetic to and aware of Russian disinformation and propaganda.  Despite that limitation, however, disinformation in Ukraine achieved its purpose to delay a strong Western reaction. Snegovaya concludes, “[t]he hybrid strategy will always pose significant challenges to the West, and it must be much more alert to the indicators of Russian attempts at reflexive control. But the West is not helpless in the face of such a strategy either. It can and must, in fact, develop a theory and doctrine of its own to counter it.”</p>
			



<p>Russia’s use of information warfare has implications for Army leaders now and in the future. Future Army forces will operate not only on physical battlegrounds, but also in the contested spaces of information and public perception. 
 Leaders must understand how to use information to fight effectively in those contested spaces and consider information operations as an integral part of planning and execution across the range of military operations. 
 To enable Army leaders to fight on battlegrounds of information and perception, the Army is releasing new Information Operations doctrine, FM 3-13, and developing an Army Concept for Operations in the Future Information Environment. 
 These initiatives will ensure an integrated approach to operations in the information environment.
 For an example of how an independent organization is countering Russian information warfare, see the great work done by the <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/" target="_blank">Atlantic Council</a> at http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/ .

			<p>Today’s operating environment requires the Joint Force to compete for superiority across the air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains.  Adversaries have proven capabilities to counter Joint Force strengths in air and maritime superiority, while also limiting access to space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). China and Russia have used the last decade to continuously modernize and reorganize their militaries to counter US Joint Force advantages in the air and on the sea.  Dr. Albert Palazzo has pointed out that “as relatively inexpensive guided weapons proliferate even non-state actors will be able to hit more or less everything they aim at.” (see <a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/LPD/_archives?articleSeries=109">ARCIC Professional Reading #109</a>, “Precision and Consequences for the Modern Battlefield”).  Because the Joint Force can no longer assume continuous superiority in any domain, land forces will have to fight multi-domain battles and project power outward from land into the maritime, aerospace, and cyber-electromagnetic domains.  </p>
			<p>The problem of capable enemies with advanced weapons able to contest multiple domains is not new.  From 1982 until the 1990s, AirLand Battle served as the conceptual framework that informed Army doctrine to fight an advanced multi-domain Soviet threat. The concept was meant to enable U.S. forces to “fight outnumbered and win” through close coordination between land and air forces.  US Joint Forces would attack the enemy in depth and seize the initiative through offensive blows delivered from unexpected directions.  Although AirLand Battle enabled American military superiority for decades, it focused on only two domains (land and aerospace) and did not address the need for forces to conduct simultaneous offense, defense, and stability operations not only to defeat enemies and secure terrain, but also to consolidate gains and achieve sustainable political outcomes. Unified Land Operations addressed those deficiencies.  (See: <a href="https://www.army.mil/e2/rv5_downloads/info/references/ADP_3-0_ULO_Oct_2011_APD.pdf" target="_blank">ADP 3.0 Unified Land Operations</a>).  This week’s professional reading informs the next chapter in Army concepts, required capabilities, and eventually, doctrine.   It is an essay that TRADOC used to inform the draft Multi Domain Battle concept.  </p>
			<p>In “Beyond Coast Artillery: Cross-Domain Denial and the Army,” Eric Lindsey argues that threats impel the Army to "get back into the business of cross-domain denial.” Lindsey makes the case that land forces are uniquely suited to deny and control multiple domains through their ability to disperse, harden, and conceal themselves.  Land forces also inherently have greater sustainment capacity of fuel and armaments than ships or aircraft. Lindsey argues that these unique attributes and capabilities of land forces mean the US Army should focus on ensuring Joint Force freedom of action.  Lindsey observes that “by denying adversaries sanctuary and freedom of action across multiple domains, Army forces could provide a form of overwatch that would enable its sister Services and its own maneuver forces to more effectively project power and operate in those areas under the ground forces’ aegis.”  Lindsey concludes with five recommendations for the Army:</p>
			<p>1. Begin developing operational concepts for cross-domain denial; 2. Use wargames to explore how these concepts might be applied in contingencies; 3. Develop prototypes of the systems envisioned; 4. Experiment with existing, partner/off-the-shelf, and prototypical systems; 5. Conduct field exercises employing concepts and systems under development.

</p>
			<p>Lindsey reinforces the idea that land forces are foundational to creating joint synergy: the complementary employment of capabilities in different domains such that each enhances the effectiveness and compensates for the vulnerabilities of the others.  Land forces ensure Joint force freedom of action through cross-domain fires and maneuver, extending mutual support across long distances, and projecting power from land into the other domains to overcome A2/AD challenges. Maneuvering ground forces with cross-domain capabilities into positions of advantage prevents enemy freedom of movement and action by turning denied areas into contested areas and serves as a deterrent and enabler for other joint operations.</p>
			<p>The Army and Marine Corps are developing the concept of Multi-Domain Battle, which calls for ready land forces capable of outmaneuvering adversaries physically and cognitively across all domains to create temporary windows of superiority to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. Simultaneous and sequential operations throughout the depth of the battlefield achieve surprise and speed of action to gain psychological as well as physical advantages over the enemy while gaining influence and control over the multi-domain battlespace. Multi-Domain Battle is not unprecedented, rather it is about using capabilities in more innovative ways to achieve Joint synergy.  Multi-Domain Battle calls for Army formations to create and exploit temporary windows of advantage.  To do this, operational and tactical level commanders will use cross-domain fires, combined arms maneuver, and information warfare to enable the opening of successive and/or simultaneous windows in depth to allow maneuver to positions of relative advantage.  As adversaries contest joint forces in one area, forces will either fight through, endure enemy actions, or bypass these effects by rapidly moving to another area where a temporary window of advantage has been created.  To execute this concept, the Army requires units which can: </p>
			<div>- Develop and sustain a high degree of situational understanding in all domains and in close proximity to the enemy and civilian populations that allow commanders to integrate intelligence and operations.  
</div>
			<div>- Employ rugged manned and unmanned combat systems that provide friendly formations with mobility, protection, and lethality overmatch against capable and elusive enemies in all terrain.    </div>
			<div>- Employ cross domain lethal and non-lethal fires that project power from land and across the electromagnetic spectrum into other domains in order to open temporary windows of domain superiority for the Joint Force and present multiple dilemmas to the enemy.  </div>
			<div>- Enhance leader, Soldier, and staff decision making through semi-autonomous systems.  </div>
			<p>On 4 October 2016, the TRADOC Commander, General David Perkins, is hosting a Contemporary Military Forum on Multi-Domain Battle during this year’s Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting. Robert Work, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, will provide opening comments. Admiral Harry Harris (CDR, PACOM), General David Goldfein (CSAF), General Perkins (CDR, TRADOC), General Robert Neller (CMC), Dr. Janine Davidson (Undersecretary of the Navy), and Major General Fergus “Gus” McLachlan (Australian Army) will serve as panel members. The panel will discuss how future land forces must fight as part of Joint and Multinational Teams across multiple domains. The panelists will share their ideas concerning how future land forces might provide the Joint Force with multiple options, integrate the efforts of multiple partners, operate across multiple domains, and present our enemies and adversaries with multiple dilemmas to win in future war.  The panel discussion and follow on effort will support the Secretary of Defense's effort to realize the third offset and ensure that the Joint Force is prepared to deter conflict and, if necessary, fight and win in future armed conflict.  </p>

<p><b>Lieutenant General McMaster Comments:</b></h4>
<p>As we think about how to develop the future force it is important to consider the conditions in which our Soldiers will fight.  Internal migration and higher birth rates are contributing to increasing urbanization around the world. By 2030 the percentage of the world’s population in urban areas will rise to sixty percent. We will have to be prepared to fight and win in cities for multiple reasons.  Enemies will operate among populations in urban areas and complex terrain to avoid U.S. military advantages.  Enemies will also operate in cities because war, waged to achieve political objectives, is inherently about people. As cities grow, many governments fail to provide adequate security, employment, infrastructure, and services.  Armed groups will exploit popular disaffection and weak governance.  Urban areas could become safe havens and support bases for terrorists, insurgents, or criminal organizations.  Urban areas are potential scenes for mass atrocities.  And enemies may use cities as launching platforms for long-range missiles that threaten allied as well as U.S. populations.  Recent conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya have demonstrated that control of population centers remain a key objective in war.  The need to conduct operations in large, dense urban areas is growing and will continue to grow.  </p>
<p>
    This week’s reading, “The Battle for Manila,” by Dr. Thomas Huber reveals lessons that apply to future operations in dense urban areas and among populations.  Huber focuses on the 37th Infantry and 1st Cavalry Divisions’ clearance of Manila in February 1945.  Due to Japanese inter-service conflict, the defense of Manila fell to the Japanese Navy with little Army support.  The approximately 20,000 Japanese defenders had little training for close combat and were not well equipped with artillery or heavy weapons.  Despite these shortcomings, the Japanese defended tenaciously with well-fortified and interlocking positions; they prevented two divisions from taking the city for a month and inflicted thousands of casualties.
Attempting to reduce collateral damage and civilian casualties, US commanders initially restricted the use of artillery, air strikes, and armor, but later found it necessary to employ all arms to force the Japanese out of strongly defended positions.   Soldiers contended with destroyed infrastructure and public services, fire, refugees, and liberated prisoners while fighting a determined enemy.   The divisions employed combined arms teams and innovative methods to overcome obstacles and complex defenses.  At the conclusion of the month of fighting, the XVI Corps consolidated gains and shifted to area security operations as they restored order and essential services to the residents of Manila.
</p>
<p>The experience of Manila has implications for future force development.  Urban environments degrade the ability to target threats with precision. Joint urban operations will require land forces capable of operating in congested and restricted urban terrain (to include subsurface, surface, supersurface) to close with and destroy the enemy.  Perhaps most important, understanding the technological, geographic, political, and military challenges of the urban environment will require innovative, adaptive leaders and cohesive teams who thrive in complex and uncertain environments. Urban operations will require decentralized combined arms and joint capabilities at low levels.  Because future enemies will act to remain indistinguishable from protected populations and infrastructure, combined arms units must possess mobility, protection, and precision firepower to fight for information, overmatch the enemy in close combat, and reduce the risk to non-combatants.  Army forces also need cross-cultural capabilities that permit them to operate effectively among populations.  </p>
<p>Army forces will conduct operations in urban areas consistent with the concept of multi-domain battle – the synchronizing of cross-domain fires and maneuver to achieve physical, temporal, positional, and psychological advantages in order to achieve temporary domain dominance and allow defeat of the enemy across all domains (see last week's weekly reading at http://warontherocks.com/2016/09/multi-domain-battle-a-new-concept-for-land-forces/). Future Army formations will gain and maintain contact with the enemy across land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.   </p>
<p>The case study of Manila highlights our two fundamental core competencies: Combined Arms Maneuver and Wide Area Security.  Combined arms maneuver is the application of combat power in time and space to defeat enemy ground forces, seize, occupy, and defend land areas and achieve physical, temporal, and psychological advantages over the enemy.  Combined arms maneuver aims to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative.  Army forces apply combat power from unexpected directions, achieve surprise, and render the enemy unable to respond effectively.  Combined arms maneuver in Manila achieved overmatch against the Japanese defenders.  The 37th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry conducted wide area security in newly cleared areas.  Wide area security is the application of the elements of combat power to protect populations, forces, infrastructure, and activities to deny the enemy positions of advantage and to consolidate gains in order to retain the initiative.  Army forces conduct security tasks to provide the joint force commander with reaction time and maneuver space.  Wide area security includes the essential stability tasks including: establish civil security; security force assistance; establish civil control; restore essential services; support governance; and support economic and infrastructure development. </p>

			<p>“A great power conflict would be quite different from the so-called ‘small wars’ of today that the US has grown accustomed to, and, in turn, others think reveal a new American weakness.  One of the key aspects is where it might take place, not in specific locations on a map like the South China Sea, but in overall domains. This will present new threats in areas where we’ve had unfettered access; indeed, the last time the US fought a peer in the air or at sea was in 1945.”</p>

			<p>American military power is joint power.</p>
			<p>Advanced threat anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) capabilities challenge the joint force’s ability to maintain freedom of movement and action.  The development and proliferation of these capabilities, such as precision-guided rockets, artillery, air defense, electronic warfare, offensive cyber, and missiles pose a threat to traditional U.S. strengths in the air and maritime domains.  State and non-state enemies will attempt to disrupt what they perceive as U.S. advantages in communications, long-range precision fires, and surveillance across all domains (i.e. land, maritime, aerospace, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum).  While long-range strike and offshore capabilities remain important to joint force operations, land forces and maneuver on land will play an increasingly important role in fighting across all domains to ensure joint force freedom of movement and action.  </p>
			<p>In “Precision and the Consequences for the Modern Battlefield,” Dr. Albert Palazzo examines the spread of precision weaponry and describes a potential swing in the “pendulum” from advantages of the offense to strengths of the defense.  Dr. Palazzo predicts a modern “killing zone” in which state and non-state groups employ long-range, precision weapons to impose losses on forces conducting offensive operations.  These weapons create effects across all domains.  For example, land-based systems have far-reaching effects into the sea and aerospace domains.  The significance is that command of the sea or air is no longer a function of being the dominant maritime or air power in a region.  Palazzo argues that “the prerequisite for the command of the sea will be command of the land.  If navies are to maneuver in waters over-watched by anti-access weapons, they can only do so if friendly forces control both their own territory and also dominate the land of their adversary.” </p>
			<p>This week’s reading reinforces the role of future land forces in supporting the joint force freedom of movement and action through the projection of power from land across the maritime, aerospace, and cyberspace domains as well as the electromagnetic spectrum. This is not a new role for land forces.  In the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great ended the threat from the Persian fleet by seizing Tyre.  In 1863, General Grant and Admiral Porter defeated the Confederate A2/AD environment at Vicksburg by a combined operation to envelop the city.  During World War II, the Allied land campaign in Western Europe ended Germany’s ability to launch submarines from the northern coast of Europe and defeated the threat to England posed by V1 and V2 rockets.  In 1973, Israeli air freedom of maneuver was restored by a ground counterattack against Egyptian surface-to-air missile sites along the Suez Canal.  Today, Russia has established air supremacy over Ukraine from the ground.  And, in the South China Sea, China is attempting to restrict freedom of navigation by projecting power from islands onto sea lines of communication.</p>
			<p>The implication for future land forces is clear.  As Admiral Harry Harris recently stated “land forces must to be able to sink ships, neutralize satellites, shoot down missiles, and deny the enemy the ability to command and control its forces.”  To this end, future land forces must integrate and synchronize joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to create temporary windows of superiority within and across domains to pose enemies with multiple dilemmas, win battles, consolidate military gains, and secure sustainable political outcomes.  Placing ground maneuver forces with cross-domain capabilities into positions of advantage preempts or counters actions of adversaries and serves as both a deterrent to the enemy and an enabler for joint operations.  The Army continues to refine the concept of Joint Combined Arms Maneuver and “Multi-Domain Battle.”  Multi-Domain Battle is cross-domain operations that create temporary windows of superiority across multiple domains, allowing Joint Forces to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. </p>
			<p>On 4 October 2016, TRADOC is hosting a Contemporary Military Forum on Multi-Domain Battle at the Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting. Senior leaders from the Department of Defense and all the services will participate.  The objective of the panel is to discuss how future land forces will fight as part of Joint and Multinational Teams across multiple domains (land, maritime, aerospace, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum).  The panel will emphasize the need for future land forces to provide the Joint Force with multiple options, integrate the efforts of multiple partners, operate across multiple domains, and present our enemies and adversaries with multiple dilemmas to win in future war.</p>

                <b>Lieutenant General McMaster Comments:</b>
            </p>
            <p>Team, </p>
            <!--------------------------------------Start of Comments-------------------------------------------->
            <p>Future armed conflict will be complex, in part, because threats, enemies, and adversaries are becoming increasingly capable and elusive. State and non-state actors employ traditional, unconventional, and hybrid strategies that threaten U.S. security and vital interests.  Complexity is increasing due to the increasing momentum of human interaction, threats emanating from dense and weakly governed urban areas, the availability of lethal weapon systems, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Enemies and adversaries will challenge U.S. competitive advantages in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.  Advanced technologies transfer readily to state and non-state actors.  Potential enemies possess the capability to threaten the U.S. homeland; there may be no safe haven in future war.  Because threats may originate in dense urban areas or remote safe havens, long-range strikes will prove insufficient to defeat them.  Fighting and winning in future armed conflict, therefore, requires Army forces capable of conducting missions in the homeland or in foreign lands including defense support of civil authorities, international disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, security cooperation activities, crisis response, or large-scale combat operations.  What all Army operations will have in common is a need for innovative and adaptive leaders and cohesive teams that thrive in conditions of complexity and uncertainty.  Two readings this week discuss leader competencies needed for the future operating environment and suggest how to develop those competencies across the Army and Joint Force.  </p>
            <p>In “Rediscovering the Art of Strategic Thinking Developing 21st-Century Strategic Leaders,” Dr. Daniel McCauley observes that strategic leaders in the joint force face unprecedented rates of change.  Previously isolated local and regional trends now constantly interact with, or can become, global trends that accelerate the rate of change.  Shifts in the geopolitical landscape caused by competition for power and resources will influence the character of armed conflict.  Accelerated change and intense competition creates uncertainty and fear as less time is available for leaders to make decisions and mitigate risk.  Dr. McCauley describes strategic thinking competencies that will give leaders the cognitive skills necessary to develop and execute strategies and plans in time-constrained environments. They include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Critical thinking – a depth and breadth of understanding that leverages hindsight, insight, and foresight</li>
                <li>Creative thinking – Overcomes assumptions, develops new paradigms and perspectives.</li>
                <li>Contextual thinking – Analyzing situations as a part of a complex continuum.</li>
                <li>Conceptual thinking – Understanding situations by integrating factors into a conceptual framework or model.</li>
                <li>Cultural thinking – Understanding the interconnected world and the perspectives across a broad spectrum of cultures.</li>
                <li>Communicative thinking – Understanding the various means of and modes of communication, and considering the challenges of communicating across organizations, societies, cultures, and nations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>McCauley argues that Joint officers must develop these competencies to enable growth in thinking skills as they progress from tactical and operational assignments to strategic assignments. </p>
            <p>In “The Strategic Development of Tactical #Leadership,” LTC Matt Rasmussen and LTC Drew Steadman discuss how Army leaders can develop their current team and prepare to lead future teams.  Rasmussen and Steadman argue that more senior tactical leaders do not have to trade junior leader training and education in mission essential tasks for the development of strategic competencies.  They argue that senior tactical leaders must develop in their junior leaders the skills necessary to lead at higher levels of responsibility through operational experience, mentorship, and self-development.  Self-development should focus on goals that strengthen the Army and the individual.  Self-development is essential to tactical leaders’ growth into strategic leaders because it develops competency in a sustained manner over time.</p>
            <p>Army leaders must understand complex wartime situations and use that understanding to develop estimates of what is needed to defeat enemy organizations and achieve sustainable outcomes.  To improve the ability to develop strategic leaders, the Army will conduct a Unified Quest Human Performance Working Group (HPWG) on 12-16 September 2016 and 12-16 December 2016 at the Army War College.  The working groups will examine U.S. structural trends in 2035-2050 as well as the physical, mental, and moral demands of future armed conflict.  Ultimately, the effort will define characteristics required for the Soldier of 2050.  The learning demands for these events are: </p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>(1) Determine the structural trends compared to peer adversaries in 2035-2050,</li>
                <li>(2) Determine the implications of these trends for human performance in the Army</li>
                <li>(3) Determine the human capabilities required for Soldiers to win in a high-intensity future conflict and assess the implications of those capabilities on Future Force design across DOTMLPF-P.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Three interdisciplinary groups will examine social, political, economic, and technological trends to determine implications to inform Army human resources strategy and Future Force development.  To learn more about the Human Performance Working Group contact Dr. Farzana Nabi at 757-501-6417 or farzana.nabi.civ@mail.mil. </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Lieutenant General McMaster Comments:</b>
                </p>
                <p>Team, </p>
                <!--------------------------------------Start of Comments-------------------------------------------->
                <p>The Army Operating Concept (AOC) asks us:</p>
                <p>"To meet the demands of the future strategic environment in 2025 and beyond, how does the Army conduct joint operations promptly, in sufficient scale, and for ample duration to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars?"</p>
                <p>Part of our Army's answer to this question is the conduct of expeditionary maneuver.    Expeditionary maneuver is the rapid deployment of task-organized combined arms forces able to transition quickly and conduct operations of sufficient scale and ample duration to achieve strategic objectives.  This week's reading provides a recent example of expeditionary maneuver that highlights the characteristics and capabilities needed in our future force to execute expeditionary maneuver.</p>
                <p>In "What It Means to Be Expeditionary: A Look at the French Army in Africa", Michael Shurkin examines the 2013 French campaign in Mali.  Operation Serval, conducted from January to July 2013, was the French response to Islamic militants' seizure of Northern Mali. French forces deployed rapidly to the area of operations and executed a combined arms campaign to defeat enemy forces and retake the cities of Timbuktu and Gao.  The French execution of expeditionary maneuver prevented a transnational terrorist organization, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb, from establishing a proto-state in the Sahel.  The main combat phase of Operational Serval ended in March, with French forces consolidating gains and setting conditions for sustainable security.  Shurkin identifies five characteristics as key to French Army success:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Ability to rapidly task organize</li>
                    <li>Balance of mobility and protection in combat vehicles</li>
                    <li>Regional expertise</li>
                    <li>Expeditionary culture</li>
                    <li>Willingness to accept risk</li>
                </ol>
                <p>French forces were designed to rapidly receive and detach elements to create combined arms task forces at battalion and below.  The use of armored, highly mobile vehicles gave the French the ability to maneuver rapidly across operational distances with a manageable sustainment burden.  And reconnaissance forces had the mobility, protection, and firepower to overmatch the enemy in encounter actions and secure the movement of friendly forces.  Regional expertise and an expeditionary culture, developed over multiple routine deployments to the African continent, allowed French forces to gain situational understanding quickly.  And, perhaps most importantly, French commanders took prudent risk while operating at the ends of long lines of communication and at the edge of their formations' capabilities.  This campaign revealed the following lessons relevant to future expeditionary maneuver:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expeditionary forces must be transportable to arrive quickly into austere environments, but have the requisite combination of mobility, protection, and firepower to transition quickly into operations and overmatch the enemy.</li>
                    <li>Forward positioned forces (such as French forces in Chad) provide options and foundational capabilities for expeditionary maneuver.</li>
                    <li>Expeditionary forces must sustain efforts for sufficient duration with the capacity (capability with sufficient scale and endurance) necessary to accomplish the mission.</li>
                    <li>Expeditionary joint task force headquarters must integrate the efforts of multiple partners.</li>
                    <li>Special operations forces and combined arms teams task-organized and trained for the mission must conduct continuous reconnaissance and security operations to create and preserve options.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Shurkin argues that the US Army design formations capable of scaling and task organizing to meet the purpose of the mission as well as developing capabilities, such as combat vehicles, that will enhance the close combat capability of our most deployable formations.</p>
                <p>Mr Shurkin's article reinforces the Army's effort to improve expeditionary maneuver capabilities.  The Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) is the Army's most deployable formation but lacks mobility once deployed and requires additional firepower and protection to maintain freedom of movement and action in close combat with capable enemies.  To improve the IBCT's capabilities the Army is pursuing the following vehicles:  the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV); the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV); and the Mobile Protected Fire power (MPF) combat vehicle.  The GMV, LRV, and MPF form an integrated suite of vehicles that close IBCT capability gaps in mobility, protection, and lethality.  For more information see the 
                    <a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/app_Documents/CVMS_SEP_Master.pdf " target="_blank"> Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy</a> .
                </p>
                <p>Robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) can also enable expeditionary maneuver.  The soon-to-be-published US Army Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) Strategy establishes objectives of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improving situational awareness</li>
                    <li>Lightening physical and cognitive workloads</li>
                    <li>Sustaining the force with increased distribution and throughput</li>
                    <li>Facilitating movement and maneuver.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The development of remotely operated and semi-autonomous ground and air combat systems that integrate into manned formations (manned-unmanned teaming) will extend the operational reach and increase the capability and agility of units.</p>
                <p>Finally, to improve Army formations' endurance at the end of extended and contested lines of communication, the Army is investing in technologies that reduce demand, increase logistical efficiencies, and improve unit self-sufficiency through lower fuel consumption, decreased waste generation, efficient storage, power and energy generation, and timely and agile logistics resupply.  Production at the point of need such as water generation on demand, 3D printing, and additive manufacturing will reduce the logistical demand, shorten mean time to repair, increase operational availability, and reduce the need for intermediate staging bases. Advanced and efficient power saving and generation technologies will reduce sustainment and lift requirements. Improved power efficiency, storage, and generation from traditional and renewable sources will provide power under austere conditions.</p>
                <p>No technology, however, will eliminate the need for commanders to take risk to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative in expeditionary operations.  ADP 6-0 defines prudent risk as "a deliberate exposure to potential injury or loss when the commander judges the outcome in terms of mission accomplishment as worth the cost." The AOC defines the tenet of initiative as "Initiative is assessing a tactical or operational situation and acting to dictate the terms of operations. A force that possesses the initiative renders hostile forces and other key actors incapable of responding effectively or organizing counter efforts."  In expeditionary operations, communications networks are austere and retaining initiative requires decentralization consistent with the philosophy of mission command, focused commander's intent, and clear concepts of operation. Commanders decentralize combined arms and other capabilities so subordinate units have the resources to act immediately on opportunities or protect against dangers.   Leaders think ahead in time to anticipate opportunities and dangers while accepting risk to gain and maintain positions of relative advantage over the enemy.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Team, </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“If you accept the premise that limited war is what the Russians are using in Crimea and Ukraine, then certain things follow for NATO. Defense-in-depth is no longer a suitable posture, as this would merely grant low-cost land grabs to Putin in a future crisis. What is needed from NATO is preclusive defense -- the defense of a frontier that contests territory from the opening round.” </p>
                        <footer> By:  Wess Mitchell, in “Post Crimea Europe: NATO in the Age of Limited Wars” (available at 
                            <a href="/LPD/_archives?articleSeries=42">ARCIC Professional Reading #42</a>), .
                        </footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <!--------------------------------------Start of Comments-------------------------------------------->
                    <p>Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and invasion of Ukraine using conventional and unconventional land forces suggest that Russia is determined to expand its territory and assert its power on the Eurasian landmass.  Russia deployed and integrated a range of diplomatic, information, military, and economic means to conduct what some analysts have described as “non-linear” operations.  Russia conducted operations to pursue war aims below the threshold that would elicit a concerted North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) response.  In addition, Russia used cyberspace capabilities and social media to influence perceptions at home and abroad and provide cover for large-scale military operations.  Since their actions in Crimea and Ukraine, Russia continues to attempt to collapse the post-World War II security order.  Recent Russian provocations include threatening NATO warships in the Baltic, reinforcing the Assad regime in Syria, and partnering with Iran to base bombers and to sell S-300 missiles, continued aggression in Ukraine, and massing troops and escalating operations in violation of the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security.  

  

</p>
                    <p>In “NATO’s Next Act: How to Handle Russia and Other Threats”, Retired General Phillip M. Breedlove, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe from 2013 to 2016, argues that NATO nations must take concrete steps to deter Russian aggression.  Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, NATO members significantly reduced their forces due to the perceived lack of a direct threat to their security.  Meanwhile, Russia modernized its forces and took actions that indicated a pattern of strategic behavior – what Jakub Grygiel and Wes Mitchell have described as “probing” on the frontier of American and NATO power.  NATO’s recent experience demonstrates that it is much easier to maintain deterrent capability and capacity than to have to rebuild it.    </p>
                    <p>General Breedlove advocates for restoring NATO deterrence with forces that are postured, positioned, and resourced to conduct conventional campaigns of sufficient size and ample duration to defeat potential Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.  He sees NATO’s ability to deny Russia’s ability to accomplish objectives through use of force as essential to deterrence.  General Breedlove concludes with a call for NATO members to commit more resources and forces both to deter Russia and strengthen the alliance.  He correctly emphasizes that “for such a strategy to be effective, the United States and its allies must demonstrate that their forces in Europe represent a credible deterrent.”  In a previous weekly reading, Jakub Grygiel agreed with General Breedlove’s argument by pointing out that “NATO states have to start modernizing, buying and increasing their capabilities to respond to the specific nature of the threat, which is no longer related to out-of-area operations but is traditional territorial defense. This involves certain capabilities that may not have been considered over the past 10 years when the priority was to project power to distant regions, rather than to defend the homeland.” ,  (
                        <a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/LPD/Archives?series=42" target="_self">ARCIC Weekly Reading #42,</a>) 
                    </p>
                    <p>NATO members are increasing readiness.  Actions include: increased U.S. funding for the European Reassurance Initiative; increased rotational U.S. forces under Operation Atlantic Resolve; and NATO’s Readiness Action Plan that creates a Very High Readiness Task Force and the establishment of full-time multinational NATO command and control presence and reception facilities on the territories of eastern Allies (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania) with units reinforcing those allies on a rotational basis.  </p>
                    <p>In general, the increased military capabilities in revisionist powers like Russia highlight the need for ready land forces to prevent conflict and shape security environments.  US Army forces have long been essential to preventing conflict through the forward positioning or rotation of forces overseas as part of our alliance obligations.  Army forces build partner capability, assure allies, and deter adversaries.  Ultimately, forward deployed and rotational land forces, as well as forces that can rapidly reinforce a theater, are essential to deter conflict because they are capable of compelling outcomes without the cooperation of the enemy.  While long-range strike and offshore capabilities will remain important to joint force operations, deterring threats from extended distance through retaliation often proves insufficient because determined adversaries attempt to achieve objectives rapidly at low cost prior to a U.S. or allied response, just as the Russians did in Crimea and Ukraine.  </p>
                    <p>To learn from recent experience and improve the combat effectiveness of future Army forces, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, in partnership with USAREUR and organizations across our Army and the Joint Force, is conducting a study of Russian New Generation Warfare (RNGW).  The study is led by the Infantry Commandant, Brigadier General Pete Jones, with MG Ricky Waddell as senior advisor.  For more information or to contribute to the effort, contact the study Chief of Staff, Colonel Kevin Butler, at 757-501-6280 or kevin.p.butler.mil@mail.mil .  There has been extensive research on the conflict and the RNGW Study aims, in large measure, to integrate that research and determine implications for Army future force development.  </p>

        &quot;General Grant also understood the essence of offensive operations.  Although he could fight direct and bloody actions when necessary, he was also a master of maneuver, speed, and the indirect approach.  His operation south of Vicksburg fought in the Spring of 1863 has been called the most brilliant campaign ever fought on American soil.&quot;

                        </blockquote>
                        <!--------------------------------------Start of Comments-------------------------------------------->
                        <p>The development and proliferation of advanced anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) capabilities such as long-range precision fires, air defense systems, electronic warfare, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) challenge the ability of the Joint Force to project power onto land from the air and maritime domains.  Russia, for example, has established air supremacy over Ukraine from the ground.  And China is building land in the South China Sea to project power outward from land into maritime and aerospace domains.  These developments demonstrate for the need for the Joint Force to develop ways to gain access to and operate in A2/AD environments.   How to maintain freedom of action in A2/AD environments is not a new problem.  Historical examples can help us develop concepts for defeating enemy A2/AD capabilities.  This week’s readings,  “The Vicksburg Campaign: Unvexing the Father of Waters,” by Terry Winschel and select chapters from General Ulysses S. Grant’s memoirs offer a historical perspective on how  joint combined arms maneuver can defeat an A2/AD defense.</p>
                        <p>Winschel describes how Vicksburg was considered the “Gibraltar of the West” after Confederate forces spent two years fortifying the city.  Cannons along its bluff controlled the broad Mississippi River below, holding off Union gunboats and protecting the flow of logistics from Texas and Louisiana to Confederate forces in the East.  Strong land defenses consisting of nine major forts with connecting trenches and a 30,000 man Confederate Army under General John Pemberton guaranteed that an attack on Vicksburg would be a long, costly operation.  Vicksburg was a strategic objective for both sides.  The Confederate A2/AD capabilities prevented movement up and down the Mississippi River and protected the sole rail link between the east and western halves of the Confederacy.</p>
                        <p>After independent attempts of land and maritime forces failed to capture Vicksburg, Major General U.S. Grant and Rear Admiral David Porter agreed, “If Vicksburg were to fall, it would be at the hands of a combined land and naval effort.” 
                            <a href="../App_Documents/LPD/Personal_Memoirs_of_US_Grant.pdf" target="_blank"> Chapters XXXII and XXXIII, of Grant’s memoirs</a> describe his operational approach to capture Vicksburg.  Grant maneuvered his army south down the west bank of the Mississippi as Porter ran his transports and river ironclads south past Vicksburg.  Naval and land forces joined back up at Grand Gulf to attempt a river crossing.  Naval fires destroyed Confederate positions as river transports ferried 20,000 Union soldiers across the Mississippi. Grant’s forces then moved 200 miles over 17 days, first to the east to isolate Vicksburg by destroying supplies and defeating Confederate forces at Jackson, Mississippi, then moving back to the west to attack Vicksburg itself.  By the end of May, using an envelopment to cut off their lines of communication, Grant negated the Confederacy’s A2/AD capabilities and completed an encirclement of the city.  Surrounded and with dwindling supplies, the Vicksburg Garrison surrendered on 4 July 1863. Grant and Porter demonstrated that, although technology is important, imaginative, determined, and courageous leadership is always vital winning in battle.
                        </p>
                        <p>This week’s readings also highlights the importance of expeditionary maneuver and Joint Combined Arms Operations to defeat enemy in an A2/AD environment.  Expeditionary maneuver is the rapid deployment of task organized combined arms forces able to transition quickly and conduct operations of sufficient scale and ample duration to achieve strategic objectives. Enabled by expeditionary maneuver, Joint Combined Arms Operations are an extension of the concept of combined arms from two or more arms or elements of one service to include the application of joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities. Union forces would have been reduced to continued inconclusive artillery duels between Confederate defenses and Union gunboats without ground forces to cut off Confederate lines of communications. Land forces, enabled by naval gunfire and transport proved to be decisive to encircling Vicksburg and compelling the enemy to surrender.  </p>
                        <p>Expeditionary Maneuver and Joint Combined Arms Operations are as relevant today as in 1863.  Operating dispersed, mobile combined arms teams are able to concentrate rapidly to isolate the enemy, attack critical enemy assets, and seize upon fleeting opportunities. Forces conduct continuous reconnaissance and security operations to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative over the enemy while protecting the force against dangers. During Joint Combined Arms Operations Army forces maneuver and project power across all domains to ensure joint force freedom of action and deny the enemy the ability to operate freely across those domains. Army leaders synchronize the efforts of multiple partners across multiple domains to ensure unity of effort. </p>
                        <p>While Union operations at Vicksburg demonstrated joint synergy in two domains, the Joint Force of the future must achieve synergy across all domains (see last week's reading).  To that end, the Army is developing a new concept, Multi-Domain Battle, to describe how land forces fight while conducting Joint Combined Arms operations in the future.  Multi-Domain Battle aims to ensure Joint Force freedom of maneuver and action by creating temporary windows of superiority across domains. Ground maneuver forces with cross-domain capabilities operate from positions of relative advantage to preempt or counter enemy actions. In the future, Joint Forces conducting Multi-Domain Battle will achieve cross-domain synergy across the land, maritime, aerospace, and cyber-electromagnetic domains in a way that is analogous to Admiral Porter's and General Grant's conduct of Multi-Domain Battle at Vicksburg.  </p>
                        <p>To learn more about and contribute to the concept and capabilities associated with Multi-Domain Battle, contact:

                                <b>Lieutenant General McMaster Comments:</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>Team, </p>
                            <!--------------------------------------Start of Comments-------------------------------------------->
                            <p>Innovation is the act or process of introducing something new, or creating new uses for existing designs.  Innovation is the result of critical and creative thinking and the conversion of new ideas into valued outcomes.  To innovate, Army leaders drive the development of new tools or methods that permit Army forces to stay ahead of determined enemies and accomplish the mission in future war.  Innovation requires anticipating changes in the character of armed conflict.  And anticipation of change requires focused and sustained collaboration across the Army, the joint community, industry, academia, and other inter-organizational and multinational partners.  Perhaps most important, our Army must be a learning organization that thinks clearly about future war, learns continuously through experience and experimentation, analyzes what it learns to prioritize and integrate solutions, and drives implementation of those solutions. </p>
                            <p>Innovation is not invention.  It entails much more than the development of technological solutions.  Innovation requires the development of capabilities that integrate changes across doctrine, organization, training, leader development, material, personnel, and facilities.  Two readings this week examine the need for an Army culture that fosters innovation by studying the past as the basis for anticipating the future.  </p>
                            <p>Written in 1996, Dr. Williamson Murray’s “Innovation: Past and Future,” analyzes how militaries innovate in resource constrained times.  Murray examined the militaries of the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s to gain insight on how those armies prepared for the next conflict.  Murray identified winners and losers in military innovation.  France, Italy, and the Soviet Union failed to innovate and paid for that failure.  Germany had a mixed record; Germany prioritized maneuver warfare at the tactical level, while ignoring not only intelligence and logistics systems essential for conducting sustained campaigns, but also the need to consolidate military gains to achieve sustainable political outcomes.  An example of effective innovation was the United States introduction of the aircraft carrier into modern naval warfare through wargames and experiments.  Murray's analysis revealed the following principles for military innovation:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Think in terms of fighting real opponents;</li>
                                <li>Learn through the use of exercises rigorous analysis of those exercises;</li>
                                <li>Ensure that lessons learned focus on more than simply validating existing doctrine and processes;</li>
                                <li>Analyze based on discrete measures of effectiveness that consider how solutions effect the opponent; </li>
                                <li>Foster Professional Military Education (PME) as the key to encouraging cultural change and intellectual curiosity.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Importantly, Murray points out that military innovation is evolutionary, not revolutionary.  He observes that, “to the British and French in summer 1940, the unfolding of German exploitation tactics, Blitzkrieg warfare, doubtless appeared as revolutionary.  But to the Germans involved in the process since the 1920s it seemed evolutionary.”</p>
                            <p>Written twenty years after Dr Murray’s article, “The Relevance of Culture: Recognizing the Importance of Innovation in Cyberspace Operations,” by LTG Edward Cardon, COL David McHenry, and LTC Christopher Cline illustrates the importance of innovation in the relatively new cyberspace domain.  They observe that the cyberspace domain is in a constant state of flux due to changing technologies that easily offset advantages because of the diminishing time between acquisition and obsolescence.  To address the complexity of cyberspace and counter the growing use of electronic warfare, cyber warfare, and information operations in hybrid war, the authors argue that the Army must not only grow a culture of innovation internally, but also must also recognize that technological innovation is now more likely to originate in the civilian sector as a result of the massive increase in technological development.  Since the military acquisition system is unable to produce capabilities at the same rate of technological change, the authors argue that the Army must work with industry and the private sector to develop capabilities. Crowd sourcing and panels such as the "Forum for Innovation and Novel Discovery" (FIND) are examples of novel ways to learn about new capabilities.  </p>
                            <p>The authors of both articles point to the need for a culture that rewards innovation, encourages initiative, empowers junior leaders, fosters collaboration, and emphasizes adaptability.  As Murray points out, “perhaps the greatest interwar contribution which military culture made to innovation was in allowing officers to use their imagination.” </p>
                            <p>One way the Army fosters innovation is through venues for collaboration.  The Army Innovation Summit III will occur 16-17 Aug 2016. Focused on the acquisition life cycle, the summit addresses obstacles to innovation at the micro and macro levels.  Breakout groups will develop solutions to improve the Army's ability to innovate.  Participants will present solutions to the Commanding Generals of AMC and TRADOC with the goal of implementing sound solutions immediately.  The summit will foster collaboration across DOD, academia, and industry.  </p>
                            <p>Another collaboration tool is the MilWiki, a DOD website which allows organizations to share problems and solutions.  The Army Warfighting Challenge MilWiki  (https://www.milsuite.mil/wiki/Army_Warfighting_Challenges ) allows soldiers and leaders throughout the Army to develop solutions to capability gaps.  </p>
                            <p>And the previously mentioned Forum for Innovation and Novel Discovery (FIND) is another venue in which industry presents innovative projects/ideas to key Army Leaders and receives feedback to refine innovative technological solutions.  On 03-04 October at the Fall Association of the United States Army (AUSA), the Army will conduct a pilot FIND.  The pilot FIND will concentrate on robotics. Follow-on FIND events will focus on a variety of topics across the Army's Warfighting Challenges to focus future force development and prioritize the Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) efforts.  

	To get more information on the FIND,

                            </p>
                            <p>This week’s readings are important because they remind us that the Army's ability to overmatch enemies and adversaries will largely depend on innovation.  Army Leaders foster a culture that values imagination, creativity, and initiative.</p>

                                        <b>Lieutenant General McMaster Comments:</b>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Team, </p>
                                    <!--------------------------------------Start of Comments-------------------------------------------->
                                    <p>Army forces depend on and complement joint efforts in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains. Because joint force freedom of movement and action across all domains are increasingly challenged by elusive land-based threats, the idea of cross-domain synergy is central not only to gaining, sustaining, and exploiting control over land, but also to projecting power across multiple domains.  Cross domain synergy poses enemies with multiple dilemmas and provided Joint Force commanders with multiple options.  To achieve cross domain synergy, Army leaders must understand capabilities and limitations of joint and multi-national partners and how to integrate efforts such that each member of the team accentuates the strengths and compensates for the weaknesses of others.  </p>
                                    <p>In “Cross-Domain Synergy-Advancing Jointness”, William O. Odom and Christopher D. Hayes examine the concept of “Cross-Domain Synergy.” Observing that cross-domain operations are not a new phenomenon, they argue that the overlap between service capabilities has become so great that joint operations have shifted from coordination along geographically defined service boundaries to integration of service capabilities within shared domains. To enhance cross-domain synergy and advance Jointness to achieve unified multi-domain effort, they argue that services must frame complex problems from a multi-domain perspective.  Odom and Hayes observe that a joint perspective requires building a comprehensive view of the adversary and the environment; understanding available capabilities; and integrating those capabilities.    They identify obstacles to cross domain synergy such as poor coordination among agencies and parochial mindsets. Overcoming obstacles requires trust and shared understanding developed through education, training, and streamlined means to access and integrate capabilities.</p>
                                    <p>The Army recognizes the shift toward operations in shared domains.  Consistent with the Joint Operational Access Concept and the Joint Concept for Entry Operations, the Army Operating Concept observes that future Army forces must maneuver across all domains to ensure joint force freedom of action against enemies that challenge U.S. competitive advantages. To support the Joint Force, Army forces conduct Joint Combined Arms Maneuver which is the synchronized application of two or more arms or elements of one service, along with the application of joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to place an enemy or adversary organization in positions of disadvantage. To enable Joint Combined Arms Maneuver across all domains, the Army is developing a concept to integrate Army capabilities within shared domains.  That concept defines Multi-Domain Battle as cross-domain operations in the context of joint combined arms maneuver that create temporary windows of superiority across multiple domains, and allow Joint Forces to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative.  Joint Force Commanders exploit temporary domain superiority by synchronizing cross-domain fires and maneuver to achieve physical, temporal, positional, and psychological advantages.  Through Multi-Domain Battle, Army forces project power across multiple domains and integrate efforts with those of other services.   </p>
                                    <p>To make the concept of Multi-Domain Battle a reality, the Army develops capability solutions to allow future Army formations to fight across the domains.  But right now, consistent with Odom and Hayes’ article, the Army and other services must seize existing opportunities to identify joint lessons learned; develop and experiment with new joint concepts and organizational ideas; improve joint training exercises and joint training centers; and examine innovative uses for existing or future systems and equipment.  A key venue for this type of joint learning is the Army Warfighting Assessment (AWA), an annual joint and multi-national exercise at Fort Bliss that builds readiness, improves interoperability, and matures new warfighting concepts and capabilities.  AWA, in partnership with the Joint Staff coalition capability demonstration and assessment, “Bold Quest”, is a critical to ensuring effective joint synergy in the conduct of Joint Combined Arms Maneuver and Multi-Domain Battle.  AWA 17 will be a PACOM focused exercise with a CJFLCC (forward), a Division TAC and MAIN CP, an Armored BCT, a Division Artillery, an Aviation Task Force, a Special Operations Company, Cyber Teams, a Sustainment Brigade, additional enablers, and brigade headquarters from the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.  Denmark and Italy will also participate via simulation in the Command Post Exercise.  Joint participation includes a Marine Corps Fly in Command Element (FICE) and an Air Force Combined Air Operations Cell (COAC) and Battlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD).  AWA 18 will blend multiple joint exercises into a two-phased operation. In conjunction with the Marine Corps exercise BOLD ALLIGATOR at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, Phase I will involve a Joint Forcible Entry Operation (JFEO).  Phase II will be the Expansion of the lodgment area at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range.  AWA 18 includes an Air Force Combined Force Air Component Commander (CFACC) Response Cell, and a Coalition Air Operations Center (CAOC) to control both live and simulated aircraft through the duration of the exercise. In addition, the exercise includes a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU).  </p>
                                    <p>Chief of Staff of the Army, General Mark Milley recently reminded us that, “developing a lethal, professional and technically competent force requires an openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things in an increasingly complex world.”  As you read this week’s article consider how our Army develops leaders and Soldiers that view problems from a multi-domain perspective.   </p>

    <b>Lieutenant General McMaster Comments:</b>
</p>
<p>Team, </p>
<!--------------------------------------Start of Comments-------------------------------------------->
<p>This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme during World War I. During the battle, British forces first used tanks to support attacking infantry, hoping to provide the overmatch needed to defeat entrenched German forces in close combat and restore mobility to the stalemated battlegrounds of the Western Front.  The following year, the British executed the first successful combined arms offensive using tanks, infantry and artillery at the Battle of Cambrai.  The British were trying to solve employ combined arms through the effective integration of infantry, tanks, and artillery.   In battle, combined arms integration is critical to achieving overmatch, the application of capabilities or use of tactics in a way that renders an adversary unable to respond effectively.  Since WWI, combat vehicles have been essential to combined arms operations and the ability to achieve overmatch.    </p>
<p>Today, potential enemies are investing in new technologies and using existing weapons in new ways to undermine U.S. forces’ ability to achieve overmatch.  Recent and ongoing conflicts in Lebanon, Libya, Syria, and Ukraine show how combining low-cost technologies and low-tech weapons can increase the lethality of individuals and small teams. For example, conventional and unconventional forces, often operating in restrictive or complex terrain, are using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), modified Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), and Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF).  As the authors of this week's readings observe, those threat capabilities highlight the need for modernized combat vehicles.  Combat vehicles give Army units the critical combination of mobility, protection, and lethality needed to overmatch determined and capable enemies in close combat.  </p>
<p>The first reading summarizes the attributes of combat vehicles and their importance to providing options to commanders.  In “Into the Greasy Grass – the Importance of the Tank in War Today and in the Future,” COL Patrick Donahoe, the chief of staff of the Maneuver Center of Excellence, highlight's the tank's value in combined arms operations.  “The MBT [Main Battle Tank provides its owner a series of options that no other system can,” – shock, speed, and lethality.  Possessing these options are critical to conducting combined arms operations.  Donahoe notes that today as in WWI, the tank restores “maneuver to the battlefield only when coupled with all arms" and joint capabilities, especially close air support.   He notes that at the tactical level of war, the combination of mobility, protection, and firepower that combat vehicles provide allow formations to overcome enemy defensive positions and maneuver to positions of advantage to dislocate enemy formations and disrupt enemy plans.  And at the operational level, armored vehicles take longer to deploy, but are essential to compelling outcomes when facing capable enemies.  </p>
<p>The second reading is a case study of the need for modernized combat vehicles when operating in urban areas against well-equipped enemies.  In “The Uncertain Role of the Tank in Modern War: Lessons from the Israeli Experience in Hybrid Warfare,” MAJ Michael Kim examines Operation Protective Edge, Israel’s 2014 incursion to degrade Hamas capabilities in Gaza. Because Hamas placed indirect fires and defensive positions within the heavily populated, dense urban neighborhoods of Gaza City, Israel's long range surveillance and fires capabilities were of limited utility.  Hamas believed that its defenses in complex urban terrain would limit maneuver options for the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and prevent the IDF from employing combined arms in offensive operations.  Facing an adversary employing a range of conventional and unconventional capabilities – ATGMs, indirect fire, IEDs, heavy machine guns, subterranean positions and routes – the IDF used their combat vehicles (including their Merkava MBTs and Namir infantry fighting vehicles) to provide mobile, protected, precision firepower in close combat with Hamas fighters.  Combat vehicles allowed IDF infantry to overmatch their opponents and seize neighborhoods from which the majority of the rockets fired into Israel originated.</p>
<p>The Merkava allowed freedom of maneuver because the IDF invested in technologies while also ensuring that units were ready to conduct combined arms operations.  After a difficult experience in the 2006 Lebanon War, the IDF identified its existing and projected operational needs and pursued comprehensive Doctrinal, Organizational, Training, Material, Leader Development, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) reforms. Foremost among those reforms was the prototyping, testing, and integration of the Trophy Active Protection System (APS). Trophy APS helped combined arms formations overmatch Hamas forces in close urban combat. MAJ Kim emphasizes three implications of Operation Protective Edge:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ability to seize and hold terrain remains a key aspect of ground warfare.</li>
    <li>Combined arms maneuver and combat vehicles are essential to dislodge an enemy from prepared defensive positions.</li>
    <li>Airpower, ISR, and standoff fire capabilities are not a substitute for ground maneuver, especially when facing determined enemies in urban terrain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Army recognizes that combat vehicle modernization is essential to maintaining overmatch.  Key to combat vehicle modernization is maintaining a robust prototyping capability that allows for the rapid integration of new technologies onto existing and future platforms.  As GEN Mark A. Milley, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, conveyed to Congress last March, “The Army will increase the use of early prototyping. Experimentation is critical for a holistic and in-depth understanding of how a material solution might be used and ultimately integrated to overcome a capability gap.” The recent decision to pursue a Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) platform for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) and the need to develop a new fighting vehicle to replace the Bradley provide opportunities to move out on the CSA’s guidance.  Prototyping will allow the integration of new technologies under innovative engineering concepts.  Those new technologies include cutting-edge VPS, particularly an APS option that allows combat vehicles to move into and dominate contested terrain.  Combat vehicle prototyping will also permit the integration of other technologies such as advanced long-range optics, directed energy weapons, single-hull casting, lightweight tracks, independent suspension, increased power production, fuel efficient engines, increased reliability, embedded training, and manned-unmanned teaming.  Early Synthetic Prototyping (ESP) will inform prototyping efforts and identify lower cost ways to integrate and experiment with new technologies for combat vehicles.  </p>
<p>This week’s readings remind us that combat vehicles are a consistent feature on an inconsistent landscape.  The Army will continue to pursue developing the best combat vehicles to allow resilient soldiers, adaptive, leaders and well trained teams to fight and win on future battlefields. </p>

                                                <b>Lieutenant General McMaster Comments:</b>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Team, </p>
                                            <p>Recent and ongoing conflicts reinforce the need to balance the technological focus of Army modernization with a recognition of the limits of technology, and an emphasis on the human, cultural, and political continuities of armed conflict. Nations and organizations in the future will fight for the same reasons that the Greek historian Thucydides identified 2,500 years ago: fear, honor, and interest. Every armed conflict exhibits some combination of violence, emotion, policy, chance, and risk. Fundamentally, war will remain a human endeavor. Although advances in technology will continue to influence the character of warfare, the effect of technologies on land are often not as great as in other domains due to geography, the interaction with adaptive enemies, the presence of noncombatants, and other complexities associated with war’s continuities. The human aspect of war includes the role of women in conflict, a consideration sometimes overlooked or underappreciated within the operational environment.</p>
                                            <p>In “Hawks, Doves and Canaries: Women and Conflict,” Brenda Opperman analyzes the roles of women in war including combatants, peacemakers, and indicators of increased violence.  Oppermann points out that women “currently account for 30-40 percent of the fighting force in many ethno-separatist groups” and “regularly serve as combatants, insurgents, and terrorists…as well as providing critical auxiliary support.”  Conflicts in Africa, Asia, and Europe have seen the use of women in unconventional forces, terrorist groups, and insurgencies as fighters, suicide bombers, and for deception.  Women also have helped movements fight on the battlegrounds of perception and influence by inciting populations to support their causes. They are active in both secular and religious groups.  Islamist terrorist groups like al Shabaab and al Qaeda, for example, actively recruit women. </p>
                                            <p>Women also influence the ability consolidate gains and achieve sustainable political outcomes in war.  Women are often agents of reconciliation after conflict.  Being highly attuned to local conditions and adept at developing strategies to survive, women are frequently at the forefront of efforts designed to facilitate transition.  For example, women built bridges between opposing communities and helped reconcile warring factions in the Solomon Islands, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Israel and Palestine, among others. Women’s stabilization and peace building efforts have also included establishing peace movements, conducting de-radicalization activities, and serving as formal and informal mediators.</p>
                                            <p>Finally, women can serve as indicators of change in complex environments.  Women’s actions and changes in their behavior can queue tactical level leaders and teams that situations are changing due to enemy action.  And changes in how women are treated can alert leaders to shifts in enemy priorities or objectives.  Women are also a source of intelligence during operations and during the consolidation of gains.</p>
                                            <p>For Army leaders, Ms. Oppermann’ s article highlights the importance of holistic assessments as conventional and special operations forces work together to understand, influence, or compel human behaviors and perceptions.  This article sheds light on an important dimension of complex conflict environments as well as opportunities to gain advantages over enemies and consolidate gains.  </p>

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="clearfix">Team, 	</p>
                                                    <p>A theory of warfare, or a description of how a military intends to achieve strategic outcomes, is essential for establishing a conceptual foundation for Army modernization.   The Army Operating Concept (AOC) is the starting point for connecting concepts and required capabilities to future force development. Informed by a grounded projection of future armed conflict, the Army Operating Concept describes how future Army forces will conduct joint operations promptly, in sufficient scale, and for ample duration to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars.  Our thinking about future war considers continuities in the nature of war as well as changes in the character of warfare.  Like the conflicts we witness today from Eastern Ukraine, to Libya, to Syria and Iraq, to Northeastern Nigeria, to South Sudan, to the Gaza strip, to Afghanistan-Pakistan, future wars will require land forces to compel strategic outcomes.  The Army's theory of future war acknowledges the need for land forces to provide foundational capabilities to the Joint Force and emphasizes the Army's role in defeating enemy organizations, controlling terrain, securing populations, and consolidating gains.  And, as we see in E. Ukraine (where Russian forces and their proxies have established air supremacy from the ground) and in the South China Sea (where China is using land to influence the maritime domain), future Army forces will have to fight multi-domain battles, projecting power outward from land into the maritime, aerospace, and cyber-electromagnetic domains to present enemies with multiple dilemmas and preserve Joint Force freedom of movement and action.</p>
                                                    <p>In “The Mud of Verdun: Falkenhayn and the Future of American Landpower,” Robert Chamberlain reinforces the importance of connecting a theory of war to concepts and future force development. His examination of the German strategic situation in 1916 also reveals that historical, social, economic, and technological factors influence the type of military a state creates to achieve military objectives and sustained political outcomes. </p>
                                                    <p>The German experience at Verdun, Chamberlain explains, resulted, in part, from a mismatch between the German Chief of Staff's theory of warfare and his tactical commanders' actions.  General Falkenhayn’s theory was based on the Army he had -- an Army organized and equipped for violent, firepower-based surprise attacks on narrow fronts.  Falkenhayn believed that inflicting disproportionate casualties in initial attacks and rapidly consolidating territorial gains would induce the French Army to commit its strategic reserve against superior German defense positions.  Chamberlain observes that while the initial German attack at Verdun was successful, Falkenhayn’s tactical commanders continued the offensive to seize Verdun rather than securing desirable defensive positions.  Eventually, German losses forced a retreat without achieving the objective of destroying the French strategic reserve.  Chamberlain’s essay highlights the importance of connecting theories of war to realistic operational concepts and grounding theory in an understanding of the human dimension of war.  </p>
                                                    <p>To avoid the pitfalls that Chamberlain identifies, our Army learns in a focused, sustained, and collaborative manner under the framework of Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs) and through Force 2025 Maneuvers.  The Army analyzes what it learns to define high risk problems, develop solutions, and prioritize efforts.  Learning events such as experiments, wargames, and the Army Warfighting Assessment ensure wise investments in future capabilities.  The key is to turn sound theories into practice.  Army leaders prioritize future force development efforts and investments in the near- (present-2020), mid- (2020-2030), and far- (2030-2050) terms.  Ultimately, the Army must implement solutions and deliver new capabilities to improve combat effectiveness. In short, to innovate, our Army must think, learn, analyze, and implement.  </p>
                                                    <p>The Army Chief of Staff's Unified Quest Future Study Plan is an important part of our Army's Campaign of Learning and is consistent with the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense's reinvigoration of wargaming across the Joint Force.  Unified Quest helps ensure sustained collaboration and learning across the Army.  It permits analysis and assessment of our theories and concepts to develop doctrine, organizations, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions to the problems of future war.  The next Unified Quest event is a Character of Future Warfare seminar at the National Conference Center from 7-10 November 2016.  This event will build on insights from the Deep Future Wargame at Carlisle Barracks in May 2016 and analyze future force operations in diverse battlefield environments to mature our vision of future armed conflict and refine our conceptual foundation for Army modernization.

                                                    <p>Continuous feedback, collaboration, and teamwork are keys to the success of the Campaign of Learning and driving innovation in the Army.  Please use the Army Warfighting Challenges as the framework to contribute your ideas and recommendations with respect to this topic to improve our ability to innovate as we develop the current and future force. </p>

			<p>Chinese leaders understood the military and political value of the Paracel Islands; the islands enable the defense of the Chinese mainland and control of sea and air routes through the South China Sea.  In 1973, both China and South Vietnam claimed the Paracels and stationed ground and naval forces in close proximity to one another.  In January 1974, when the South Vietnamese navy harassed Chinese fishing vessels, the PLA seized the initiative and asserted their control of the islands.  After a short battle resulting in the South Vietnamese Navy’s retreat, the Chinese quickly moved soldiers and militia to the islands to consolidate gains and achieve a durable political outcome.  Chinese political leaders were careful to control the level of violence and keep it below a level that might provoke U.S. retaliation.  Land forces proved essential in providing that control.</p>
<p>Since the 1974 battle, these islands and others in the South China Sea have become Chinese bases. The Chinese have created new islands from reefs and constructed runways, piers to accommodate warships, military garrisons, and other support infrastructure.  The Chinese military clearly intends to project power outward from land into the maritime and airspace domains.</p>
<p>
    Today China employs combinations of conventional and unconventional forces in a way that is analogous to Russian New Generation Warfare in Eastern Ukraine. As Dr. Yoshihara points out “Russia, too, resorted to the use of paramilitary troops to dismember parts of Ukraine while avoiding a wider conflict with the West.”  Andrew S. Erickson and Conor M. Kennedy’s essay "  
            <a href="/App_Documents/LPD/Erickson-and-Kennedy.pdf" target="_blank">China’s Maritime Militia:</a> What It Is and How to Deal With It” explains current Chinese actions and identifies continuities between recent aggression and the 1974 Paracels conflict. China’s maritime militia is a key enabler to their operations in the South China Sea.  In addition to allowing the Chinese to operate below the threshold of U.S. and partner military response, the militias expand the pool of available forces and are a tool to influence neighbors. 
</p>
<p>Professor Yoshihara’s historical example combined with Erickson and Kennedy’s current example help us understand how future enemies and adversaries will continue to use combinations of conventional and unconventional forces and cross-domain capabilities to conduct sophisticated multi-domain campaigns. Unconventional or irregular forces backed by significant conventional capabilities give adversaries the ability to compete below the threshold of war to achieve objectives.  Seizure of key terrain astride important sea and air lines of communication allows adversaries to intimidate weaker neighbors at little cost and low risk.  And, advanced capabilities positioned on key terrain poses a threat to Joint Force freedom of action in times of crisis.</p>
<p>These essays demonstrate how history and ongoing experience can inform future force development.  As part of the Joint Force, Army forces must be able to defeat enemy organizations, control terrain, secure populations, consolidate gains, and preserve joint force freedom of movement and action in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.  Placing ground maneuver forces with cross-domain capabilities into positions of advantage preempts or counters actions of adversaries and serves as both a deterrent and enabler for joint operations. Army forces provide cross-domain synergy through cross-domain fires and maneuver by extending mutual support across long distances, projecting power from land into the other domains to overcome anti-access and area denial challenges, and ensuring friendly force freedom of action while denying the same to an adversary. As Admiral Harry Harris stated in May 2016, the Joint Force needs Army forces “to be able to sink ships, neutralize satellites, shoot down missiles and deny the enemy the ability to command and control its forces.” </p>
<p>The Army is developing a range of capabilities to conduct Joint Combined Arms Maneuver and “Multi-Domain Battle.” Joint Combined Arms Maneuver is the synchronized, simultaneous, or sequential application of two or more arms or elements of one service, along with joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to create multiple dilemmas for the enemy and seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. Multi-Domain Battle is cross-domain operations in context of joint combined arms maneuver that create temporary windows of superiority across multiple domains, and allow Joint Forces to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative.  A critical component of Multi-Domain Battle is Cross-Domain Fires.  Cross-domain fires is the employment of joint and combined mutually supporting lethal and nonlethal fires across all domains to create multiple dilemmas for the enemy, achieve overmatch, and enable Joint Combined Arms Maneuver.  Investments in critical capabilities that enable Multi-Domain Battle such as expeditionary mission command, future vertical lift, enhanced cross-domain fires capabilities, robotics and autonomy-enabled systems, and advanced protection will enable future Joint Combined Arms Maneuver and Multi-Domain Battle.</p>

                                                        <p>Team, | Happy Independence Day.</p>
                                                        <!--------------------------------------Start of Comments-------------------------------------------->
                                                        <p>Anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict. Technological advances and changes in strategic guidance, joint operating concepts, and security challenges require the U.S. Army to innovate to ensure that forces are prepared to accomplish future missions.  In their conclusion to the book The Dynamics of Military Revolution: 1300-2050, Williamson Murray and McGregor Knox identified the following four characteristics of successful military innovation:</p>
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li> Innovation does not come from technology alone.</li>
                                                            <li>Innovation emerges from evolutionary problem-solving directed at specific operational and tactical issues.</li>
                                                            <li>Innovation requires coherent frameworks of doctrine and concepts.</li>
                                                            <li>Innovation must be rooted in and limited by strategic givens and continuities in the nature of war.</li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                        <p>While not the sole factor in military innovation, integrating emerging technologies is essential for improving future force combat effectiveness. Because of the ease with which many technological advantages are copied or countered, however, the Army must pursue multiple technological improvements and anticipate enemy efforts to emulate or disrupt new capabilities. Moreover, maintaining the Army's differential advantage over enemies requires from the integration of advanced technologies with skilled Soldiers and well-trained teams.</p>
                                                        <p>In this week's professional reading, "Cheap Technology Will Challenge U.S. Tactical Dominance," Dr. T.X. Hammes considers the history of technological adoption and innovation by militaries.  He uses the example of battleships and naval aviation from 1914 to 1939 to show how combinations of multiple technologies changed the character of warfare.  Large investments made in mature technologies (battleships) produced incremental improvement, while moderate investments in new or disruptive technologies produced massive increases in capabilities (aircraft and aircraft carriers).  Hammes points out that the transition from the dominance of the battleship to the aircraft carrier took twenty years. Investment in mature and emerging capabilities is necessary to maintain readiness and stay ahead of determined adversaries.</p>
                                                        <p>Dr Hammes considers evolving technologies in the areas of additive manufacturing, nanotechnology, space capabilities, artificial intelligence, and unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs and UGVs).  He emphasizes capabilities created when two or more of these technologies are combined.  For example, autonomous UAVs combined with additive manufacturing makes possible the employment of "thousands of UAVs (or UGVs) in wave attacks." Russian forces in Ukraine have already demonstrated the combination of UAVs with massed fires and electronic warfare capabilities.</p>
                                                        <p>Dr Hammes argues that small states and non-state groups will benefit most from the diffusion of military technologies.  Adversaries will use these technologies to erode the U.S. Joint Force competitive advantages.  And adversaries will be less restrained than the US in their use of these technologies because they do not fight under the same legal and ethical constraints.  These technologies, Dr. Hammes contends, will lead to the "revival of mass (in terms of numbers) as a key combat multiplier."</p>
                                                        <p>Dr. Hammes' essay helps us to think clearly about future armed conflict by considering threats, enemies, and adversaries, anticipated missions, emerging technologies, opportunities to use existing capabilities in new ways, and historical observations and lessons learned.  Our Army must accelerate new technologies into the force to maintain the ability to overmatch increasingly capable potential enemies. Increasing the speed of innovation requires institutional reform and sustained collaboration among Army, DOD, national research and development communities, industry, academia, and international partners.  Consider the technological first principles of the

                                                        <p>This fall's Annual Army Warfighting Assessment (AWA) at Ft.

AWA gives our Army a triple pay-off in readiness, future force development, and interoperability:</p>

                                                            <li>Training Readiness: The AWA is a live, virtual and constructive division-level Joint/Multinational training exercise that provides a unique opportunity to increase innovation, improve interoperability and enhance unit readiness. Army leaders gain experience operating in a joint and multi-national environment. Opposing forces are also live and constructive and have unique threat capabilities, such as live cyber attacks, electronic warfare and unmanned aerial systems.</li>
                                                            <li>Interoperability: the Army partners AWA with the Joint Staff J6 Bold Quest exercise to focus on network and mission command system interoperability. Bold Quest brings significant joint and multinational forces and capabilities to the AWA, including the development of a coalition network; all exercise participants (Bold Quest and AWA) will operate on the coalition network. Bold Quest also includes a large variety of US joint and coalition aviation platforms.</li>

                                                            <p>When thinking about the problem of future war, Army leaders must make a special effort to think in time and connect historical knowledge to contemporary problems.  While understanding the potential pitfalls of reasoning by historical analogy, Army leaders need history to help place contemporary problems in context.    Although Army leaders focus primarily on the land domain, the behavior of potential adversaries across all domains is also important to consider.   This week’s readings use historical and contemporary examinations of China’s actions in the South China Sea to draw out lessons relevant to Army and Joint Force modernization.</p>
                                                            <p>The People’s Republic of China continues to pursue a long-term, comprehensive military modernization program designed to improve the capacity of its armed forces to fight and win short-duration, high-intensity regional contingencies. Military modernization supports China’s policy goal to expand influence and replace the post-World War II security, economic, and political order in Asia with a new order more sympathetic to Chinese interests.  To avoid direct confrontation with the U.S., China often uses civilian assets in military roles. China’s behavior creates friction with regional neighbors including U.S. allies and partners and threatens the rules-based order that has generated unprecedented security and economic growth in Asia and beyond since the end of World War II.</p>
                                                            <p>In “The 1974 Paracels Sea Battle: A Campaign Appraisal,” Professor Toshi Yoshihara describes a short battle in the South China Sea between South Vietnam and China. This January 1974 conflict foreshadowed how China is seeking control over the sea and air today through the creation and seizure of land bases and the use of military, paramilitary, and civilian capabilities.  </p>
                                                            <p>Across the past seven decades, U.S. land forces have had a fundamental role in deterring great power conflict.  Deterrence in Europe during the Cold War depended, in large measure, on the synergistic effect of a globally responsive and forward positioned joint force – to include land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale to deny enemy objectives.  Although air and naval power contribute indispensable capabilities to the Joint Force, stand-off and offshore military capabilities seek to deter adversaries through the threat of punishment.  Land forces possess capabilities essential to deterrence by denial - convincing an adversary that he cannot accomplish objectives through force at an acceptable cost.  Moreover, land forces communicate intent unambiguously.  Forward positioned land forces are the most credible signal of U.S. commitment to a nation or region. </p>
                                                            <p>In “Landpower and American Credibility,” Michael Allen Hunzeker and Alexander Lanoszka describe the value of forward positioned and capable land forces to U.S. national security.   Their essay is consistent with the work of Thomas Schelling in the 1970s: to deter an enemy means persuading him that he cannot accomplish his objectives.  Forward, physical presence of capable, credible forces conveys national commitment and intent.  Physical presence also assures allies, improves interoperability, and enables contextual understanding of the operational environment. </p>
                                                            <p>Consistent with Schelling, Hunzeker and Lanoszka argue that effective deterrence depends on the ability to fight and win if war does occur.  Because land forces have the attributes of survivability, staying power, and a psychological effect on adversaries, they are essential to the Joint Force’s ability to deter.  That is because potential enemies know that land forces can hold and control territory and impose high costs.</p>
                                                            <p>The authors conclude with three implications for the Army and the Joint Force.  First, the United States must maintain capacity in land forces to conduct operations of sufficient scale and ample duration to both deter and, if necessary, win.  Second, forward presence is essential because “allies are hard to reassure ‘on the cheap’”.  And finally, the US Army should develop concepts and conduct experimentation “…in the areas of forcible entry from air, space, and sea, distributed land operations.”</p>
                                                            <p>The absence of sufficient U.S. land forces increases an adversary’s willingness to try for a fait accompli before U.S. forces can be brought to bear.  History supports their argument.  In 1947, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal complained about the "drain upon Army resources in the form of occupation troops" and that the occupation in Korea was a "source of unceasing complaint from parents of the enlisted men who were unhappy, dissatisfied and bored."  As we now know, the result of undervaluing the effect of forward positioned US combat formations from in South Korea set conditions for the North Korean invasion in June 1950 and a costly war.  And, as we have learned from the reduction of U.S. land forces from Europe after Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008, it is far more difficult to restore a forward based deterrent once it has been dismantled.  Yet, today there are some who argue for 'off-shore balancing' or 'deterrence from afar.'</p>
                                                            <p>Recent events in Europe and the Korean Peninsula highlight the continuing need for forward positioned land forces.  Some have argued that risk to national security is increasing associated with an Army that may lack the capacity, be insufficiently modernized, and out of position to deter determined and increasingly aggressive adversaries. As the former Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Breedlove, observed in a recent Foreign Affairs article, deterrence requires both forward positioned capable forces and the ability to reinforce those forces rapidly in times of crisis. </p>

                                                                <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                                                                <p>Since the Korean War, the U.S. Joint Force has operated in a relatively uncontested manner in the air, maritime, space and cyber-electromagnetic domains.  This is not only due to technical advantages, but also to the professionalism and excellence of the US Air Force and Navy.  It is clear, however, that the diffusion of technology is eroding US supremacy in these domains.  For example, anti-access and area denial capabilities challenge the Joint Force’s ability to achieve air dominance and sea control as well as its ability to project power onto land from the air and maritime domains. Russia, for example, has established air supremacy over Ukraine from the ground.  China is building land in the South China Sea to project power outward from land into maritime and aerospace domains.  Potential enemies are developing cyber-electromagnetic and space capabilities (such as disruptive and destructive malware; electronic warfare systems and anti-satellite weapons) to disrupt communications and precision navigation and timing.  It is for these reasons that the Joint Force must combine land, air, maritime, space and cyber-electromagnetic capabilities to maintain US competitive advantage over enemies and adversaries.  Joint Combined Arms capabilities create multiple dilemmas for the enemy and provide commanders with multiple options.    The Joint Force must resist the temptation to develop single service or simple solutions to the complex problem of future armed conflict.  Single service or narrow technological solutions will prove inadequate to deter conflict and, if necessary, to respond to and resolve conflict.  The Joint Force must be able to conduct cross-domain fires and maneuver in the context of Joint Combined Arms Maneuver, the synchronized application of two or more arms or elements of one service, along with the application of joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to place the adversary in positions of disadvantage.  </p>
                                                                <p>In “The Lure of Strike,” Dr. Conrad Crane examines the American tendency to seek easy victory through long-range technological solutions in lieu of joint solutions that integrate fires and maneuver.  Examples from the Spanish-American War demonstrate that efforts to solve complex problems from stand-off range are not a new phenomenon.  Crane demonstrates that in each case the joint force has rediscovered the need to integrate service capabilities to create opportunities that pose enemies with multiple dilemmas and to consolidate gains.  Crane’s analysis accentuates the observation in the Army Operating Concept that “American military power is joint power.</p>
                                                                <p>Dr. Crane highlights the need for complementary joint force capabilities and capacity.  Although long-range strike capabilities should not be regarded as a simple answer to the complex problem of future war, they are vitally important.  And, without maritime and air superiority, US ground forces are vulnerable to enemy action, assuming that they could even deploy to an area of operation.  </p>
                                                                <p>Crane’s analysis reminds us that maneuver and fires are inseparable and complementary.   Cross-domain fires enable freedom of maneuver.  For example, in the Yom Kippur War (1973) when one-fourth of the Israeli Air Force was downed by the Egyptian air defense belt, the Israeli Army freed the Israeli Air Force for normal operations by maneuvering behind the advancing Egyptian Army and destroying the air defense belts.  Joint forces employ cross-domain fires and maneuver to achieve periods of superiority across all domains and enable joint force freedom of action.  </p>
                                                                <p>The Army is investing in a range of cross-domain fires and maneuver capabilities to improve the Joint Force's ability to conduct Joint Combined Arms Maneuver:</p>

Shifts in the geopolitical landscape caused by competition for power and resources influence the character of armed conflict. These shifts, and violence associated with them, will occur more rapidly than in the past due to advances in technology, the proliferation of information, and the increased momentum of human interaction.  Recent and ongoing conflicts reinforce the uncertainty of war, and the need to emphasize the human, cultural, and political continuities of armed conflict.   </p>
                                                                    <p>In this week’s reading, “The Hell After ISIS,” Anand Gopal examines the human, cultural, and political consequences surrounding the emergence of ISIS and the civil wars in Syria and Iraq.  He describes the spread of sectarian violence that has “Sunni tribes fighting the Shia-dominated government and Sunni tribes divided against one another.”   Gopal documents the story of Faelah Sabar and his family as ISIS forces them to flee their home in Iraq’s Anbar Province, eventually finding that there are no safe havens, even within the capitol city of Baghdad.  Gopal highlights ISIS’s use of murder and other forms of brutality for coercion.  He describes ISIS's ability to mobilize people, money, and weapons to seize territory and establish control of populations and resources.  He explains how ISIS exploits social divisions and marginalizes competing insurgent groups.   Gopal sheds light and understanding on the lawlessness across Iraq and distrust in governmental authority that strengthens ISIS and frustrates efforts to establish enduring security.  Gopal’s discussions with local Sunnis led him to conclude “that even if this campaign succeeds in toppling ISIS, it will have done nothing to address the fundamental divides that helped produce the group in the first place.” His analysis emphasizes the need for political accommodations to consolidate gains and achieve sustainable outcomes.</p>
                                                                    <p>The essay highlights the need for Army leaders to generate, develop and maintain understanding in complex environments. Because adversaries operate not only on physical battlegrounds, but in other contested spaces such as perception, criminality, and political subversion, Army leaders need to understand not only enemy organizations, but also the populations among whom wars are fought.  Army leaders must consider the political, historical, tribal, religious, and ethnic dynamics that often effect their mission and the security situation.  Gopal’s essay reminds us that war is profoundly human and the human aspects of military operations must inform planning and the conduct of war.  In complex environments like Iraq, conventional and special operations forces must operate in close contact with the enemy and civilian populations to understand, influence, or compel human behaviors and perceptions.  </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Lieutenant General McMaster Comments:</b>
                </p>
                <p>Team, </p>
                <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                <p>Core competencies are the Army’s strengths, strategic advantages, and essential contributions to the Joint Force.  Core competencies provide focus for leader development, force design, and unit training.  The Joint Force relies on the Army to provide the core competencies of combined arms maneuver and wide area security.  Combined arms maneuver is the application of combat power in time and space to defeat enemy ground forces, seize, occupy, and defend land areas and achieve physical, temporal, and psychological advantages over the enemy.  Wide area security is the application of the elements of combat power to protect populations, forces, infrastructure, and activities to deny the enemy positions of advantage and to consolidate gains in order to retain the initiative.  Key to the ability to conduct combined arms maneuver and wide area security are capable combat vehicles.  Combat vehicles provide Soldiers and units with the combination of mobility, lethality, and protection necessary to defeat enemy forces, seize, occupy and defend land areas, and achieve positional, temporal, and psychological advantages over the enemy.  A modern and ready combat vehicle fleet is essential to achieve overmatch, which is the combination of capabilities that prevent enemy organizations from successfully using their equipment or employing their tactics.  While fighting against increasingly capable and elusive enemies, maintaining overmatch requires combat vehicles that are resistant to enemy anti-armor systems, able to maneuver to positions of advantage across a wide variety of terrain, and provide advantages to commanders and Soldiers across the full range of military operations.</p>
                <p>In “Tactics and Mechanization” Colonel J.F.C. Fuller examines the development of the tank in World War I and provides an excellent example of the clear logic trail necessary to develop concepts and required capabilities for combat vehicles.  Fuller learned from previous experience to anticipate the future.  Fuller understood the military application of a new technology: “petrol-power” and “mechanical-power.”  Using recent history and lessons learned, he anticipated how combat vehicles would change the character of warfare.  He analyzed how those changes would demand new doctrine, organizations, and material solutions.  Finally, Fuller proposed an implementation strategy for the development of modern combat vehicles and employment as part of combined arms teams.</p>
                <p>Fuller’s analysis of mechanization at the end of World War I holds valuable lessons for the US Army today.  Fuller’s process of thinking, learning, analyzing, and implementing solutions was grounded in a clear vision of warfare that recognized changes in the character of warfare, but did not ignore the continuities in the nature of war. </p>
                <p>Fuller’s use of “tactical functions” is useful today to describe combat vehicle capabilities needed to enable combined arms maneuver and wide area security.  Infantry BCTs (IBCT) require combat vehicles with the appropriate combinations of mobility, protection, and firepower to overmatch enemies in close combat.  Using Fuller’s terms, IBCTs need a Light Reconnaissance Vehicle “to discover,” “to hold,” and “to protect” the main body as it approaches objectives.  When the infantry begins their assault, they need Mobile Protected Firepower “to protect” and “to hit” by destroying local fortifications, point defenses, and blocking positions to maintain freedom of maneuver.  And in the Armored BCT, the Future Fighting Vehicle and Future Tank are required “to smash” enemy formations through speed, lethality, and shock effect in an attack or defending against a counter-attack.  Fuller also reminds us that in all types of combat formations, the key is combined arms since the “…idea of the discovery of a universally decisive arm…is as mythical as the universal solvent of the alchemists.  Each arm is superior to any other arm when conditions permit of it developing greater effect.”</p>
                <p>Past history, as well as recent conflicts demonstrate that countermeasures arise from every change of technological change in warfare.  As Fuller points out, for example, the use of gas in WWI was quickly countered. Massed artillery was countered by defensive improvements.  </p>
                <p>Our Army learns in a focused, sustained, and collaborative manner.  Our Army the Army experiments with DOTLMPF solutions at the annual Army Warfighting Experiment and the recently concluded Network Integration Exercise.  Recently, Senior Army leaders, intelligence specialists, and leading futurists met for Unified Quest 2016 at Carlisle Barracks, PA to consider warfighting in the years 2030-2050.  The findings, coupled with initial insights from the New Generation Warfare Study, highlight changes in technology and society that influence the character of warfare.  To adapt to change the Army must develop new capabilities to fight, win, and accomplish the mission as part of the Joint Force.  For example during Unified Quest, the airborne operation confirmed the need for a light reconnaissance vehicle and mobile protected firepower. </p>
                <p>Consistent with Fuller’s essay, our Army needs modernized combat vehicles across all formations.  Crosscutting technologies are essential to improve the future force’s combat effectiveness through reduced logistical demand, improved reliability and reduced life cycle costs, and simpler systems that are easier to operate and sustain.  Synthetic and live prototyping will improve our ability to innovate and integrate new technologies with well-trained soldiers and teams. The Army is prioritizing combat vehicle prototyping to deliver improved mobility, protection, and firepower to our Army and drive change and improve collaboration across S&T, requirements, and acquisition partners. Neglecting to do so leaves the Army in danger of fighting the next war like the last, the same fear that animated Colonel Fuller to write his article.  Fuller may not provide the answer for today, but he helps ask the right questions and teaches us how to think about the problem of future war and capabilities our Army needs to fight and win.</p>

Nations and organizations in the future will fight for the same reasons that the Greek historian Thucydides identified 2,500 years ago: fear, honor, and interest.  Fundamentally, war will remain a contest of wills.  Anticipating and preparing for the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict. </p>
                                                                            <p>Chapter 2 of the AOC identifies five characteristics of the future operational environment that are likely to have significant impact on land force operations.  In the future environment, the speed at which information diffuses through multiple means will increase velocity, momentum, and degree of interaction among people. The diffusion of information via the Internet accelerates interaction between people, governments, militaries, and threats. Access to information allows organizations to mobilize people and resources locally, regionally, and globally. The weekly reading provides an example of how the cyberspace domain contributes to that accelerated interaction among people and is growing in importance as global, and regional and non-state actors invest in capabilities to protect and advance their interests.</p>
                                                                            <p>In “Cyberwar in the Underworld: Anonymous versus Los Zetas in Mexico," Paul Rexton Kan (Professor of National Security Studies at the US Army War College) examines a short cyber-based conflict between the hacker group Anonymous and the Mexican crime cartel Los Zetas.  This cyber conflict involving two non-state actors had public safety and national security consequences in a nation-state.  Kan illustrates the convergence of information operations, the cyber domain, and the physical domain.  He explains how Los Zetas used cyber operations to protect its personnel and secure its ability to continue physical operations.  In this example, Los Zetas paired cyber operations with a credible threat of violence to overmatch Anonymous who possessed only technical capabilities.  The essay reveals that cyber operations, when combined with force, can overmatch an adversary.  Kan’s article also reveals that technology is easily transferred and that enemy organizations will expand to the battlegrounds of perception and influence and operate across domains including cyberspace.  </p>
                                                                            <p>Cyberspace is a contested domain.  Cyberspace operations, enabled by our global network, can have effects in both the virtual and the physical world.  Commanders must view networks as warfighting systems and ensure the readiness of personnel and equipment.  Cross-domain operations and maneuver must include the cyberspace domain and the electromagnetic spectrum. Commanders and staffs must coordinate, integrate, and synchronize Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) with operations across the land, air, maritime, and space domains.  This is an extension of idea of joint combined arms maneuver, the synchronized application of capabilities critical to accomplish the mission. </p>

                                                                                </p>
                                                                                <p>Team, </p>
                                                                                <p>The weekly reading provides a perspective on the role of landpower in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.  The United States National Security Strategy published in 2015 emphasizes the importance of the region:  “As we have done since World War II, the United States will continue to support the advance of security, development, and democracy in Asia and the Pacific.”  While largely a peaceful region for more than 70 years, North Korea remains dangerous and unpredictable, China is modernizing its military and appears to be expanding its strategic intent, violent extremism is rising, and transnational crime is rampant.  Growing security challenges demand consideration of how Army forces might assist the Joint Force in securing the nation’s vital interests.  </p>
                                                                                <p>In a recent speech to a meeting of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Admiral Harry Harris Jr., Commander, U.S. Pacific Command asked, “What is the role of land forces in ensuring access to shared domains?”  After describing security challenges in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, Admiral Harris highlighted that land forces are important in helping identify and counter threats from foreign terrorist fighters; combating human trafficking; and protecting coastal borders.  He challenged his audience to develop “other ideas…about the future roles of land forces” and explore “what the armies of archipelagic countries can do in the defense of shared maritime spaces.”  Admiral Harris' question is important to United States Army future force development efforts.  </p>
                                                                                <p>In “Strategic Landpower in the Indo-Asia-Pacific,” Dr. John Deni considers the role of landpower in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.  He warns that it has become conventional wisdom to say “the US Army has only a minimal role in the region” and that the Army’s primary role is “guarding against a North Korean invasion.”  He argues that, in a region that holds five nuclear nations, seven of the world’s ten largest land armies, and where the Army is the predominant service in 26 of 36 countries, the U.S. Army provides unique capabilities and functions.  He identifies “bolstering the defense of allies and deterring aggression; promoting regional security and stability through security cooperation; and ameliorating the growing United States-China security dilemma” as three broad categories in which the Army contributes to theater security.  He concludes that defense and deterrence are critical roles for the Army and specifically in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region because the Army is essential to “shaping the international environment and preventing conflict.” </p>
                                                                                <p>Dr. Deni’s description of the role of landpower in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region is consistent with the Army Operating Concept.  Regionally engaged Army forces ensure interoperability, build relationships based on common interests, enhance situational awareness, assure partners, and deter adversaries.  Should deterrence fail, Army forces, as part of globally responsive joint combined arms teams, are able to maneuver and project power from multiple locations and domains to conduct joint combined arms operations and ensure joint force freedom of action and deny the enemy the ability to operate freely across those domains.  Army forces consolidate gains by integrating with partner military, law enforcement, and civil capabilities to establish and maintain security, to achieve sustainable political outcomes. Discussions at LANPAC next week in Honolulu will help refine ideas and concepts including the Army's foundational role in cross-domain fires and maneuver.</p>

                                                                                    <p>Team, </p>
                                                                                    <p>Preventing war, and the human suffering it entails, has long been a vital element of U.S. national security strategy and military strategy.  Although our diplomatic and economic instruments of national power have significant roles in forestalling conflict, our joint military power is essential to deter aggression and preserve peace in a wide variety of locations, and under a wide variety of conditions.  For example, US forces have been forward stationed on the Korean Peninsula for more than six decades to deter conflict with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).   Today, North Korea, continues to threaten South Korea through the expansion of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and belligerent activities.  These actions highlight the need to maintain a credible deterrent force on the peninsula and the capability to deploy substantial ground, air, and maritime forces to fight as part of a coalition in defense of South Korea and the region.  This week’s professional reading uses historical analogy to describe what a future conflict in Northeast Asia might look like.  The essay emphasizes the need for a joint and multi-national force capable of conducting joint combined arms maneuver to defeat North Korea should deterrence fail. 

	</p>
                                                                                    <p>Niv Farago’s essay “The Next Korean War: Drawing Lessons From Israel’s Experience in the Middle East”, uses case studies of Israeli conflicts to envision a future war in Korea.   Farago argues that a war on the Korean Peninsula would happen in two phases: first, a limited conventional conflict followed by guerilla operations by North Korea on both sides of the DMZ.  While North Korea has substantial conventional capability, it does not possess the capability to conduct a war of annihilation against South Korea.  North Korean aggression would likely include an incursion into South Korea to seize limited territorial objectives.  Although South Korea has the capacity to execute a large scale counterattack to seize Pyongyang, Seoul may be dissuaded from penetrating too deeply into North Korea by the North’s nuclear capabilities and support from Russia and China.  As a result, the war could devolve into a protracted war fought on both sides of the DMZ.

	</p>
                                                                                    <p>Farago views North Korea’s military position as analogous to Egypt in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.  Egyptian forces made a very successful, limited initial attack across the Suez Canal to seize key terrain.  After this initial success and defeat of Israeli counterattacks, Egyptian leadership made the fateful decision to move deeper into the Sinai beyond their capability to support maneuver forces with the requisite density of air defense.  Israeli forces operating in joint combined arms teams conducted a successful counterattack that crushed the Egyptian Army.</p>
                                                                                    <p>Farago also views Hamas and Hezbollah operations in Lebanon in 2006 and Gaza in 2014 as analogous to how North Korea might execute subsequent guerilla operations in occupied territory and throughout South Korea.  In both Lebanon and Gaza, Hezbollah and Hamas combined rocket and mortar attacks with complex defense in depth to frustrate Israeli attempts to stop attacks on Israeli territory.  And, in both cases, the Israelis found that strikes by aircraft and artillery could not stop indirect fire attacks.  Ground offensives were necessary to stop attacks and cause adversaries to relent. </p>
                                                                                    <p>Conflicts in 1973, 2006, and 2014 revealed how enemies seek to evade strengths (such as long-range surveillance and precision strike) through traditional countermeasures (such as dispersion, concealment, and intermingling with civilian populations).  The Israeli experience in the Sinai, Lebanon, and Gaza campaigns highlight the need to counter lethal and hidden enemies through joint combined arms maneuver.  Inadequate joint doctrine and integration between services complicated efforts on land and in the air.  Farago’s imagined future Korean conflict also highlights the need for synergy across the land, maritime, aerospace, and cyberspace domains.


</p>
                                                                                    <p>Implications for the future force are clear.  Army forces depend on and complement joint efforts across all domains to enable joint operations.  Army forces support joint force freedom of movement and action from land across the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.  Because elusive land based threats challenge joint force freedom of movement and action, Army forces must be prepared to maneuver and overmatch enemies in close combat.  Army forces must control terrain to deny its use to the enemy.  In future joint operations, Army forces must also project power from land into the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains to support joint force freedom of action and restrict enemy freedom of action.</p>
                                                                                    <p>Ground maneuver forces with cross-domain fires capabilities can provide a credible capability to deter adversary aggression and deny enemy freedom of action.  Responsive Army cross-domain fires with extended range and enhanced precision help the Joint Force to overcome anti-access and area denial threats, support Army operations on land across wide areas, and project power from land into the other domains to preserve joint force freedom of action.  Maneuver forces provide the ability to overcome enemy countermeasures, compel outcomes, and consolidate gains for sustainable outcomes.</p>

            <!--HEADER-->
            <p>Team, </p>
            <p>Since World War II the prosperity and security of the United States have depended, in large measure, on the synergistic effects of capable land, air, and maritime forces. They have reinforced one another in the conduct of joint operations and together provided options that any one or two services could not provide alone.  Army forces, alongside multiple partners, fight across multiple domains and pose enemies with multiple dilemmas to win battles, consolidate military gains, and secure strategic outcomes.  Army combined arms teams integrate with other services and mission partners to conduct joint combined arms maneuver (the synchronized application of two or more arms or elements of one service, along with the application of joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to gain positions of relative advantage over the enemy).  One of the critical capabilities for joint combined arms maneuver is Close Air Support (CAS).  Our military history across the last century provides countless examples of the value of CAS in achieving overmatch and seizing, retaining, and exploiting the initiative in battle.  Since aircraft first appeared on the battlefield CAS has been essential to preserving freedom of maneuver and action in close contact with the enemy.  Integrated air-ground operations complicate the situation for the enemy and pose enemies with multiple, simultaneous problems.  CAS allows ground commanders to extend the battlefield in time and space, seize upon fleeting opportunities, and gain psychological and temporal as well as physical advantages over the enemy.  </p>
            <p>The conduct of integrated air-ground operations is not easy.  The effective integration of CAS is dependent on sound doctrine; organizational design; training; equipment and ammunition solutions; and leader development and education.  In a paper written after World War II, MG Ernest Harmon stated, “Let no one think that this close support can be quickly worked out or that because a system has been developed in one division that the same system can be employed with another division without first going through an intensive training period with both the air and the ground people involved.”  Harmon concluded that with sound doctrine, proper equipment, special skills, and extensive training, air-ground operations can be “tremendously effective.”    </p>
            <p>In this week’s professional reading, “A Retrospect on Close Air Support,” I. B. Holley examines CAS during and between wars and arrives at a conclusion similar to Harmon.  Holley acknowledges the success of CAS in wartime, but focuses mainly on the atrophy of effectiveness that occurs between wars.  He warns that the “processes and procedures by which success was achieved, usually belatedly, in each war… were largely forgotten by the armed forces by the time they again became actively involved in fighting.”  He argues this “indicates a failure to codify the necessary doctrines of close air support properly to pass on the tactics and techniques, the procedures, and indeed the attitudes found essential” to conduct this important mission.  These failures, he insists, manifest because of the low priority and resources the joint force affords the CAS mission between conflicts.  Holley urges leaders and units to develop, understand, and internalize doctrine.  CAS doctrine must be “actively inculcated by a regular and repetitious training program.”  Effective CAS requires “workable organizational structures and effective procedures to ensure a smoothly functioning close support system” as well as equipment necessary to accomplish the mission.  </p>
            <p>Work on future CAS capability began last year under the leadership of General Mark Welsh, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and General Herbert J. “Hawk” Carlisle, Commander, Air Combat Command.  Army leaders are working with sister-service representatives to identify CAS lessons learned; develop and experiment with new CAS concepts and organizational ideas; revise and codify CAS tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP); improve CAS training exercises and joint training centers; and examine innovative uses for existing or future systems and equipment.  Central to the effort is the Army Warfighting Assessment (AWA), an annual joint and multi-national exercise at Fort Bliss that builds readiness, improves interoperability, and matures new warfighting concepts and capabilities.  AWA, in partnership with the Joint Staff coalition capability demonstration and assessment, “Bold Quest”, is a critical to ensuring effective future CAS in the conduct of Joint Combined Arms Maneuver.  Contact Mr. Bill Rittenhouse, (757) 501-5475, clement.w.rittenhouse.civ@mail.mil, and Mr. Mace Langston, (757) 501-5480, thomas.m.langston.civ@mail.mil to contribute to this ongoing work. </p>
            <p>Additionally, on 11-12 May, 2016, the Joint Staff is hosting the 16th Annual Joint Fires and Joint Close Air Support Symposium.  The forum provides the Fires/CAS community an opportunity to gather, share ideas and observations, and develop ways to improve Joint and Combined Fires/Joint CAS.  The intent of the symposium is to emphasize improvements stemming from operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine and Syria.  Insights from the symposium will help inform future capabilities development.  The event is being held at the Monarch Ballroom, Westin Virginia Beach Town Center, 4535 Commerce St, Virginia Beach, VA 23462.  For further information about the symposium, please contact Lt. Col. Sean R. (Waldo) Monteiro, at (312) 836-0489, sean.r.monteiro.mil@mail.mil.</p>

            <p>Team, </p>
           <p>Combat vehicles are essential to joint combined arms operations; operations that integrate infantry, armor, artillery, engineers, aviation, and joint capabilities to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative over the enemy. Combat vehicles have proven their value in all types of terrain and tactical environments from open desert to mountains, jungles, and cities. And combat vehicles provide general capabilities to Soldiers that enhance their ability to fight, including networked communications, load carrying, and power generation. Most importantly, combat vehicles provide Soldiers with the mobility, protection, and lethality to gain positional and temporal advantages and overmatch enemy forces in close combat. This week’s readings highlight the importance of executing a combat vehicle modernization strategy to ensure Army forces are prepared to fight and win.</p>	
		   <p>In “The Future is Growing Brighter for U.S. Combat Vehicles,” Dr. Daniel Gouré argues that combat vehicles are essential to deterring aggression and winning conflicts when deterrence fails. He argues that the complexities of the land domain, coupled with the human nature of war will limit the effects of long range fires.  Because enemies will evade long range precision strike capabilities, Army forces must be capable of defeating enemies in close combat. </p>	
		   <p>Our Army’s ability to close with and destroy enemy forces through fire and maneuver is essential to convince potential enemies that the United States Joint Force is capable of imposing outcomes without their cooperation.  Gouré observes that, “When it comes to deterring a high-end conventional adversary, it appears that there is no substitute for treads (and wheels) on the ground.”  Gouré urges investment in combat vehicles because of increasing adversary capabilities and what he describes as inadequate U.S. Army combat vehicle modernization.</p>	
		   <p>The second essay considers how combat vehicles enhance the mobility, lethality, and protection of airborne forces and in doing so, provide leaders with options for responding to a broad range of contingencies.  In “Reimagining and Modernizing U.S. Airborne Forces for the 21st Century,” Dr. David E. Johnson and Dr. John Gordon IV argue that the future operating environment requires capable airborne formations equipped with modern combat vehicles. They envision a future operating environment in which adversary anti-access and area denial capabilities prevent forcible entry operations directly onto objectives.  Airborne forces that possess the appropriate combination of mobility, lethality, and protection are, therefore, essential to provide the President, Secretary of Defense, and Combatant Commanders with options to resolve crises or set conditions for larger scale joint force operations.  Their essay is consistent with the Army Operating Concept’s emphasis on expeditionary maneuver, the rapid deployment of task-organized combined arms forces able to transition quickly and conduct operations of sufficient scale and ample duration to achieve strategic objectives.</p>	
		   <p>The U.S. Army Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy (CVMS), published in 2015, describes the ends, ways, and means necessary to ensure that future Army forces are prepared to overmatch the enemy in close combat.  The Army must sustain current vehicles, improve existing systems, develop new capabilities, replace obsolete vehicles, and assess new technologies and concepts.  The strategy prioritizes Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) investments in the near term to provide those formations with combinations of mobility, protection, and firepower consistent with their mission profile.  In future armed conflict, IBCTs or smaller combined arms task forces will need to move from off-set objectives or staging areas to get to the fight.  IBCT cavalry squadrons equipped with Light Reconnaissance Vehicles (LRVs) will screen forward of infantry mounted in Ground Mobility Vehicles (GMVs) to provide early warning of enemy activity and ease the formation’s forward movement.  As infantry approach attack or assault positions, Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) vehicles allow infantry forces to transition to dismounted fire and maneuver.  In close combat, MPF vehicles destroy enemy defensive positions and vehicles with precision direct fire and ensure infantry freedom of maneuver in restrictive and urban terrain. </p>	
		   <p>This week’s essays highlight the need for combat vehicle modernization not only for IBCTs, but also for Stryker and Armored Brigade Combat Teams.  Ongoing improvements to existing combat vehicles are necessary, but cannot extend the effectiveness of current combat vehicles indefinitely.  For example, with no current major ground combat vehicle development program underway, and under current funding levels, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Abrams tank could remain in the Army inventory beyond obsolescence.  </p>	
		   <p>Despite limited resources, the Army is initiating prototyping to integrate new technologies and develop IBCT Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) while pursing short-term non developmental alternatives for IBCT Ground Mobility Vehicle, Light Reconnaissance Vehicle, and MPF. Additionally, the Army will integrate active protection systems to protect vehicles and formations from modern anti-armor systems. Stryker lethality and mobility upgrades are underway beginning with the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment. Abrams and Bradley upgrades continue while the Army replaces the M113 with the Armored Multipurpose Vehicle and seeks resources to develop a Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) for infantry and cavalry in ABCTs.  The work on MPF prototyping will also inform FFV requirements and design.  And the Army will integrate robotic and autonomous system technologies with combat vehicles to improve the combat effectiveness of all formations.  </p>

            <p>Team, </p>
            <p>"During joint combined arms operations Army forces maneuver and project power across all domains to ensure joint force freedom of action and deny the enemy the ability to operate freely across those domains."  Army Operating Concept</p>
            <p>American military power is joint power and the Army both depends on and supports air and naval forces across the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains. The Army depends on sister services for strategic and operational mobility, fires, close air support, communications, intelligence, and other capabilities.  Because enemies endeavor to avoid U.S. strengths and disrupt U.S. advantages, the integration of joint capabilities is essential for posing those enemies with multiple dilemmas.  While enemy countermeasures to air power and precision strike such as dispersion, concealment, deception, and intermingling with civilian populations limit the effectiveness of stand-off capabilities, those same countermeasures make the enemy vulnerable to land forces in close combat.  And when land forces place something of value to the enemy at risk, the enemy is compelled to concentrate which, in turn, increases enemy vulnerability to air power and long range fires.  It is clear that long-range strike and offshore capabilities will remain important to joint force operations.   It is also clear, however, that ready land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and ample duration are essential to defeating capable and determined enemies.  Land forces (Army, Marine Corps, and Special Forces) give the joint force the ability to overcome enemy countermeasures, compel outcomes, and consolidate gains.</p>
            <p>In the first reading (#88A), “Israel’s Operation Protective Edge: Showcase for the Limits of Precision Strike?,” Michael Haas argues that, despite the Israeli Defense Force’s (IDF’s)  “unrivaled body of knowledge about its opponents (expert terrain knowledge, an established and unmatched ISR network, and complete sea, air, and space superiority throughout the theater), stand-off precision strike proved incapable of stopping Hamas from firing rockets into Israel in the spring and early summer of 2014.  After initial Israeli air strikes, Hamas employed countermeasures that frustrated Israeli intelligence collection and the effectiveness of subsequent strikes.  Although Phase I of Operation Protective Edge inflicted damage on Hamas, Israeli precision strikes alone were insufficient to compel Hamas to cease attacks into Israel.  Similar observations led Eitan Shamir, in a Spring 2015 essay “Rethinking Operation Protective Edge,” to conclude that “air operations and stand-off fire are not enough to decisively win a conflict and that ground combat is necessary against adaptable enemies like Hamas.”     </p>
            <p>In the second reading below (#88B), the conclusion of “Aerial Interdiction: Air Power and the Land Battle in Three American Wars,” Eduard Mark makes a similar argument that air interdiction was an important and necessary component of military campaigns, but proved inadequate to win due, in large measure, to insufficient intelligence and the inability to identify elusive targets.  The eight conditions favoring interdiction that Mark identifies are often absent due to nature of the enemy or enemy countermeasures.  Additionally, Mark warned years ago that air superiority, a historical U.S. advantage due to the extraordinary capability and competence of the U.S. Air Force, should not be taken for granted.  Today that warning seems prescient as Russia maintains air supremacy over Ukraine from the ground and China attempts to expand territory in the South China Sea to project power outward from land to restrict freedom of movement in the maritime and aerospace domains.  Both readings make clear that, today and tomorrow, success in deterring conflict and winning wars will depend on the synergistic effects of capable land, maritime, aerospace, and cyberspace forces that together achieve outcomes through effective operations across all domains.  </p>
            <p>Increasingly, land forces and the US Army in particular will have to project power outward from land to ensure joint force freedom of movement in the air and at sea.  In their written statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee on 8 Mar, 2016, Ms. Darlene J. Costello, Lt. Gen. James M. “Mike” Holmes, Lt. Gen. John W. “Jay” Raymond, and Lt. Gen. Arnold W. Bunch, Jr. made a compelling case for joint synergy, warning that, ““for the first time in decades, our adversaries are closing in on our capability advantage.”  While noting that air operations against ISIL have “disrupted their communications, reduced their financial capacity and degraded their freedom of maneuver”, they “recognize there are limits to what U.S. airpower can accomplish.  Airstrikes alone will not achieve our full military objectives.”  Their testimony was consistent with Air Force Chief of Staff Mark A. Welsh’s observation about the air campaign against ISIL in January of 2015, “You don't direct end states from the air.  You don't control territory, you don't influence people, you don't maintain lines of control after you've established them. That will take a ground force."  It is important that Army leaders recognize that there is no single service solution to the complex problem of war.  Consistent with that recognition, our Army is working with the Air Force and Marine Corps on future close air support and developing new Army capabilities to project power outward from land into the maritime, aerospace, and cyber-electromagnetic domains.  Operating across multiple domains creates and preserves multiple options for joint force commanders.                     </p>
            <p>As you read this week’s essays consider potential doctrinal, organizational, training, materiel, leader development, and personnel solutions the Army should develop to improve joint integration in the conduct of Joint Combined Arms Maneuver.  </p>

            <p>Team, </p>
            <p>The consolidation of gains is an integral part of armed conflict and is essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies and adversaries.  Confronting corruption is often essential to consolidating gains.  A failure to do so can inhibit the achievement of sustainable political outcomes consistent with campaign objectives and national interests.  For example, in Afghanistan corruption and organized crime networks perpetuate state weakness and undermine the state’s ability to cope with the regenerative capacity of the Taliban.  In his Jan 2016 Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) testimony, General John W. Nicholson emphasized, “Corruption poses a strategic threat to the long-term stability of Afghanistan as it undermines security, government legitimacy, and prospects for economic development.”  This challenge is not unique to Afghanistan.  Around the world, numerous other cases illustrate how corruption undermines governance and threatens mission success and long term stability.   And successful examples of confronting corruption and organized crime, such as experiences in Columbia and South Korea, demonstrate the tremendous potential associated with effective reforms.  Military leaders must understand conditions that enable corruption as well as effective techniques to reduce corruption such that it no longer poses a fatal threat to missions or the viability of partners.      </p>
            <p>In “Confronting the Threat of Corruption and Organized Crime in Afghanistan: Implications for Future Armed Conflict,” Tim Sullivan and Carl Forsberg observe that “corruption and organized crime have undermined efforts to build Afghan institutions, consolidate security gains, achieve political progress, encourage economic growth, and set conditions for enduring stability.”  The authors argue that corruption fuels discontent, generates active support for the insurgency, prevents growth of a strong licit economy, and perpetuates dependency on international assistance even as it undermines donor confidence.  They conclude that, “Long-term U.S. objectives – including the elimination and prevention of transnational terrorist safe-havens – remain dependent upon strengthening the Afghan state and hardening its institutions against the resurgence of the Taliban, the onset of further civil conflict, and the interference of the country’s neighbors.”  Sullivan and Forsberg close their essay with ten lesson that are important not only to success in Afghanistan, but also in future conflicts  that require US forces to “engage in operations in which corruption and organized crime will serve as drivers of conflict, as well as impediments to sustainable security, host nation security force development, political progress, and economic growth.”  </p>
            <p>The Army Operating Concept recognizes that enemy organizations operate beyond physical battlegrounds in contested spaces such as perception and information, criminality and corruption, and political subversion.  To consolidate gains, Army leaders will often have to exert influence on key individuals, organizations, and institutions through cooperative and persuasive means.  For example, when mission accomplishment requires strengthening partner institutions, Army forces exert influence to convince those partners that undertaking necessary reforms and strengthening critical institutions are in their interest.  An emphasis on early and effective consolidation activities as a fundamental part of campaign design enables success beyond physical battlegrounds and achieves lasting favorable outcomes in the shortest time span. </p>
            <p>Sullivan and Forsberg, both of whom served in Task Force Shafafiyat (Transparency) in Afghanistan, recognize that the consolidation of gains requires close civil-military coordination and unity of effort and that U.S. and allied forces must anticipate and address corruption and organized crime in counterinsurgency, security force assistance, and stabilization operations.  In particular, Army leaders must be prepared to help integrate military, intelligence, law enforcement, financial, contracting, development, and information efforts to reduce the threat of corruption and organized crime to the mission.  As you read Sullivan and Forsberg’s essay, consider how to integrate their lessons into U.S. Army training, doctrine, and leader development.  You might also refer to "

This week's reading has particular relevance to the following Warfighting Challenges:</p>

            <p>Team, </p>
            <p>In their February 24, 2016 written statement to the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Defense, the Honorable Patrick J. Murphy, Acting Secretary of the Army and General Mark A. Milley, Chief of Staff of the Army wrote, “The global security environment is increasingly uncertain and complex.  Opportunities to create a less dangerous world through diplomacy, economic stability, collective security, and national example exist, but military strength is both a complementary and foundational element of National power in a dangerous world.  Each element is necessary in combination with the others; however, each alone is insufficient to win a war or maintain a peace.  The conditions of diplomatic success, for example, are more likely if military options are credible, real, and perceived as unacceptable to an adversary.”  In this week’s reading, Robert Kaplan examines the declining economic conditions in Russia and China and warns that their internal political stability can no longer be taken for granted.  Kaplan, like Mr. Murphy and Gen. Milley, argues that a strong Joint Force is essential to secure vital U.S. interests should China and Russia, fueled by internal domestic crises, continue to engage in "daring, reactive, and impulsive behavior" internationally.  </p>
            <p>In “Eurasia’s Coming Anarchy,” Kaplan argues that China and Russia, as they experience increasing domestic troubles, could engage in belligerent actions to “distract disgruntled citizens and mobilize their populations.”  Kaplan contends that to deter those belligerent actions the U.S must avoid needless provocation while setting clear red-lines that protect international borders and maritime boundaries.  The Joint Force must be ready to back those commitments with military power.  He advocates for an increased US forward military presence in Europe and Asia to deter conflict and preserve options for diplomacy.  </p>
            <p>Kaplan's essay reinforces the need for land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and duration to shape the security environment, assure allies, and deter conflict.   While long-range strike and offshore capabilities will remain important to joint force operations, deterring threats from extended distance through retaliation often proves insufficient because belligerent powers might attempt to achieve objectives rapidly at low cost prior to a U.S. or allied response.  Moreover, Kaplan argues that "compared with ships and planes, ground troops constitute a more credible demonstration of U.S. power, because they advertise the country’s willingness to shed blood to honor its commitments."  </p>
            <p>Kaplan's essay is relevant to a Joint Staff initiative to revitalize deterrence in professional military education.

Waldhauser, USMC, observes that “Deterrence today is more complex and in some ways more difficult than during the Cold War.  We must now deter multiple nuclear armed-states simultaneously through multiple domains, across multiple regions, and with multiple methods, including forward presence and the use of conventional forces.”  He notes that current joint professional Military education “generally treats nuclear deterrence as a Cold War relic and cross-domain deterrence as an interesting experiment.”  He urges the Joint Force "to raise the bar in content and in levels of learning across the Joint Force.”   
            </p>
            <p>Kaplan’s essay sheds light on shaping security environments, assuring allies, and deterring conflict.  His analysis is important to our work on the following Army Warfighting Challenges:</p>

	<p>In his confirmation hearing to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford on July 9, 2015, told the U.S. Senate Armed Services committee that Russia currently poses the greatest global threat to the United States. While many understood this assessment as based on Russia's new aggressiveness, its nuclear modernization program and militarization of the Arctic, there is more to the story. </p>

                <p>Diverse enemies will employ traditional, unconventional, and hybrid strategies to threaten U.S. security and vital interests. Threats may emanate from nation states or nonstate actors such as transnational terrorist, insurgent, or criminal organizations.  Enemies and adversaries will operate beyond physical battlegrounds and employ sophisticated strategies that integrate propaganda, disinformation, political subversion, cyber-attacks, and criminal activity.  These aspects of future armed conflict are apparent today as Russia attempts to intimidate allies and partners along the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s frontier.    </p>
                <p>For example, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine demonstrated a sophisticated combination of diplomatic, informational, military, cyber-electronic, and economic means to achieve objectives below a threshold that would elicit a concerted NATO response.  Military means employed reveal Russia's effort to pursue differential advantages in several areas.  In Ukraine for example, the combination of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Offensive Cyber and advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities reveal new technological capabilities and new tactics.  It is clear that while our Army was engaged primarily in Afghanistan and Iraq, Russia studied US capabilities and embarked on an ambitious and, based on operations in in Ukraine and Syria, largely successful modernization effort. </p>
                <p>In this week’s reading, “Cyber Threats and Russian Information Warfare”, Paul Joyal examines improvements in Russian cyber and information warfare capabilities.  He observes that the Russian military and security services used Crimea as a test bed to prepare for future war.  He states, the “Crimea campaign represents a new crystallization of an integrated strategy of geopolitical projection and political warfare” through the use of cyber operations in combination with covert military and intelligence forces.  The political warfare campaign in Crimea “included the entire spectrum of influence operations”.  Supported by cyber capabilities, Russian information warfare aims to “destroy the key military, industrial, and administrative sites and systems of an enemy, and to inflict psychological and information damage on the military and political leadership as well as the troops and population”.  Joyal concludes that Russia will continue to seek asymmetric advantages to offset gaps in conventional military capabilities.  </p>
                <p>Cyberspace and space are growing in importance.  Revisionist states such Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea as well as non-state actors are investing in capabilities to protect their communications and disrupt or deny access to others.  In the future, enemies and adversaries are likely to collaborate as contests in space and cyberspace extend to and affect tactical operations.  Because Army operations are inherently cross-domain, Army forces depend on and complement joint efforts in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains to enable joint operations.   Since Joint force freedom of movement and action across all domains are challenged increasingly by elusive land-based threats, Army operations must remain ready to develop situational understanding in contact and close with and destroy those threats.  Army forces must also conduct land-based cross domain operations to ensure Joint Force freedom of action while restricting enemy freedom of action.   Commanders and units must also be prepared to operate with degraded systems due to enemy cross-domain attacks.   </p>
                <p>Joyal’s essay highlights that future armed conflict will be complex, in part, because state, non-state, and hybrid threats are increasingly capable and are narrowing US competitive advantages not only on land, but also in the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.  To maintain overmatch against increasingly capable enemies, our Army must maintain readiness for today and invest in modernization to ensure readiness for tomorrow.  This week’s essay is important to our work under the following Army Warfighting Challenges:  </p>

                            <p>Team, </p>
                            <p>The speed at which information diffuses globally through multiple means increases the velocity, momentum, and degree of interaction among people.  The diffusion of information via the Internet and social media amplifies and accelerates interaction between people, governments, militaries, and threats.  Access to information allows organizations to mobilize people and resources locally, regionally, and globally. Disinformation and propaganda extend efforts beyond the physical battle ground and into the contested spaces of public perception and political subversion where they drive violence in support of political objectives.  The compression of events in time requires Army leaders and forces capable of responding rapidly into these contested spaces to seize the initiative, influence the narrative, and consolidate order.  </p>
                            <p>In "The U.S. Is Losing the Social Media War," Dr. Rand  Waltzman warns that adversaries such as ISIS and Al Qaeda have proven adept at  using social media to proliferate half-truths, lies and falsehoods in order to  discredit U.S. and coalition actions, to recruit new members and financial  backers, and to spread their version of reality.  Dr. Waltzman also highlights Russia&rsquo;s  domination of European media space with the thinly veiled propaganda of Russia  Today (RT) and an immense army of state-backed internet trolls.  He argues that the United States&rsquo; ability to  seize the initiative, influence the narrative, and consolidate gains is  constrained because, unlike our adversaries, the United States Army is bound by  laws and ethics to be truthful when communicating with audiences and using  social media.  He observes that Army  leaders are often hesitant to engage audiences using social media and fail to  plan for it as a fundamental part of operational planning and campaign  design.  He concludes, "The use of social  media and the Internet is rapidly becoming a powerful weapon for information  warfare and changing the nature of conflict worldwide.  Because of misaligned U.S. policies and laws,  we continue to largely rely on only conventional warfare techniques, which puts  us at a severe disadvantage."</p>
                            <p>A purposeful, well developed social media campaign is critical to mission success in today's hyper-connected operational environment.  Under our Mission Command doctrine, commanders "Inform and influence audiences, inside and outside the organization."  Social media provides commanders an unprecedented ability to communicate with disparate audiences to influence attitudes, perceptions and beliefs.  Social media provides a medium through which commanders can reach audiences to influence the narrative, counter disinformation, clarify intentions, expose enemy brutality, and bolster the legitimacy of partners.  Openly engaging relevant audiences with the truth is critical to seizing, retaining, and exploiting the initiative as well as consolidating gains.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Waltzman's essay contains important ideas.  Future Army forces will operate not only on physical battlegrounds, but also in the contested spaces of information and public perception.  Leaders must understand that social media provides an opportunity to fight effectively in those contested spaces.  </p>
                            <p>Consider how to make the effective use of social media an integral part of planning and execution of operations across the range of military operations.  This week's reading is relevant to the following Army Warfighting Challenges:</p>

                    <p>Threats to national security emanate from nation states and non-state actors such as transnational terrorists, insurgents, and criminal organizations.  Areas of ineffective governance provide an inviting environment for criminal organizations.  Under weak governance criminal violence expands and erodes state institutions and undermines security.  Defeating insurgent and criminal threats is more than a military-only task.  Achieving sustainable outcomes is an inherently civil-military task that requires integrated planning and execution of political, diplomatic, military, economic, informational, intelligence, and, increasingly, law enforcement and rule of law efforts.  This week’s professional reading emphasizes collaboration between insurgent and criminal organizations in Colombia and the efforts of the Colombian government to re-establish security and political authority across the country.  The reading serves as an important case study of how to consolidate gains and achieve sustainable outcomes.</p>
                    <p>In “Colombia: A Political Economy of War to an Inclusive Peace”, David Kilcullen and Greg Mills summarize Colombia’s long fight against criminal, terrorist, and insurgent forces.  They introduce the term “conflict entrepreneurs" to describe individuals and organizations that seek "to perpetuate war for personal gain rather than to win (and thereby end) the conflict.”  They describe the success of ‘Plan Colombia’, the whole of government effort used to defeat various insurgent and criminal groups and bring peace to the country.  Despite impressive security results achieved in the past ten years, however, Kilcullen and Mills argue that “a comprehensive conflict transformation is needed – one that moves Colombia from a political economy of violent exploitation to one of inclusive, sustainable peace.”  They conclude that Colombia has achieved “an amazing turnaround in security that offers lessons for others facing similar challenges” while warning that the country must remain vigilant to consolidate those gains politically.</p>
                    <p>Kilcullen and Mills’ article highlights that the consolidation of gains is essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies and adversaries.  Enemy organizations operate on physical battlegrounds and in other contested spaces such as perception, criminality, and political subversion.  Similar to the actions of the FARC, ISIL seized opportunities associated with communal conflict and weak governance.  The American experience in Iraq, though very different from the experience in Columbia, may be seen in retrospect as a failure to consolidate military gains.  </p>
                    <p>The Columbia experience demonstrates that early and effective consolidation activities as a fundamental part of campaign design enables success and achieves lasting favorable outcomes in the shortest time span.  To consolidate gains, Army forces (and in this case mainly Special Operations Forces) often play a supporting role by reinforcing and integrating the efforts of multiple partners.  Success takes time.  The Columbia experience reveals that that there are no short term solutions to long term problems; sustained US efforts are often needed to consolidate gains and win (see also experiences in South Korea, the Balkans, and the Sinai).  Columbia's success also reveals that with strong indigenous leadership and sustained partnership based on common interests and mutual trust, great achievements are possible. </p>

<p>	Words matter, for they reflect the quality of thinking and affect the judgments we make and the actions we take. In our everyday speech about the Army and what it does, the term “decisive” is often used as an absolute. For example, “The Army is the decisive force.” The problem is, decisive is a relative term in three important and relevant senses. First, decisive is relative to context; second, to combinations; and third, to proper use.

	<p>In last week’s reading, “The Contemporary Spectrum of Conflict: Protracted, Gray Zone, Ambiguous, and Hybrid Modes of War”, Dr. Frank G. Hoffman observed that capable and elusive enemies will employ traditional, unconventional, and hybrid methods of warfare to threaten U.S. security and vital interests. He discussed gray-zone modes of war, and argued that winning in the gray-zone requires a clear understanding of an adversary’s ends, ways, and means. </p><p>In the first of this week's two short essays, “Definition of ‘Decisive’ Depends on Context”, Lt. Gen. James M. Dubik, U.S. Army, retired, argues that “settling” a war is dependent on the political aim and that all elements of national power are required to achieve a strategic win.  He states, “A military campaign is designed to attain part of a strategic aim, or set the conditions for the attainment of a strategic aim.  So decisiveness at the operational level may mean not settling a matter, but producing a definitive result that, in turn, sets the conditions for other acts – whether military or not – to settle an issue.”  He concludes that “settling a war involves much more than settling a fight.”   </p><p>In the second reading, “How Should We Think About “Gray-Zone” Wars”, Antulio J. Echevarria explains how some adversaries advance national interests through offensive military operations conducted below the level of violence that would trigger a concerted international response.  He cites the calculated aggression of Moscow in Ukraine and Beijing in the South China Sea as examples and argues their “intentionally” designed operations are “the outgrowth of strategies aimed at exploiting the West’s legalist view of war and its inherent restraints.” He observes that “Moscow and Beijing have been able to exploit this zone of ambiguity to accomplish wartime-like objectives” outside the scope of what military strategists and western politicians are prepared to address.  He concludes that military strategist must be quick to recognize an adversary’s objectives and provide political leaders with options that allow the preservation of US vital interests. </p><p>Echeverria's argument that deterrence requires convincing the adversary that he cannot accomplish his objectives at an acceptable cost draws into question the trend since 1991 of withdrawing forward positioned military forces to the continental United States.  Forward positioned forces are important because they offer important strategic advantages in deterring conflict, reassuring allies, and improving the responsiveness of the US military.  One might argue that forward basing is also economical because it is cheaper and easier to deter something that has not yet happened.  And secure overseas bases actually reduce the amount of force needed for overseas contingencies.   Moreover, consistent with General Dubik's theme of integrating military and political efforts, forward basing bolsters diplomatic efforts to prevent allies from becoming drivers of instability themselves.  Recent experience in Europe demonstrates that it is much harder to rebuild deterrence once it has atrophied than to keep it intact.  As the recently published US European Command strategy observed “the temporary presence of rotational forces complements, but does not substitute for an enduring forward deployed presence that is tangible and real. Virtual presence means actual absence.”   </p><p>Both readings highlight that decisiveness and winning mean the ability to achieve sustainable political outcomes consistent with U.S. vital interests.  Army forces are foundational to the Joint Force's ability to, alongside inter-organizational and multinational partners, deter conflict and win wars.  Army forces are critical to deterring conflict and shaping security environments through forward presence and sustained engagement with allied and partner land forces.  When called upon, Army forces conduct prompt and sustained operations on land to defeat enemy forces and seize, hold, and defend land areas.  And Army forces are essential to the consolidation of gains.</p><p>This week's essays are relevant to the Joint Staff J7's important work on a new Joint Concept for Integrated Campaigning and the following Army Warfighting Challenges:</p>

<p>Team, </p>
<p>The world is a more dangerous place than at any time since the end of the Cold War. U.S. rivals from Europe to the greater Middle East, to East Asia are changing realities on the ground by annexing territory, intimidating U.S. allies, and using proxies as unconventional forces under the cover of conventional forces to advance their interests.  China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea often act below the threshold that would elicit a concerted response from allies and partners in their efforts to increase regional influence at the expense of U.S. interests.  What some have called “gray zone” activities that stretch from Syria to Ukraine, to the South China Sea are the subject of our weekly reading.   In</p>

Dr. Frank G. Hoffman cautions against developing forces to address only a narrow range of conflict.  Future force strategies developed in this manner fail to “understand opponents, their strategic cultures, and their own unique conceptions of victory and war.”  Dr. Hoffman argues that “future opponents have their own ideas about how to fight, and they tend to mix and match those ideas with deliberate combinations of modes of conflict” based on their own national interests.    National security relies on understanding the range of military operations and being prepared to confront adversaries who employ strategies and techniques designed to avoid U.S. strengths. Hoffman warns that defining future war as one might like it to be leads to the following consequences: “unreasonable political and public expectations for quick wins at low cost; an overly simplistic grasp of the application of blunt military power and what it will supposedly achieve; and naïve views of both adversaries and the context for conflict.” 

            
<p></p>
<p>Hoffman’s views are consistent with the observation in the Army Operating Concept that diverse enemies will employ traditional, unconventional, and hybrid strategies to threaten U.S. security and vital interests.  These threats may emanate from nation states or non-state actors such as transnational terrorists, insurgents, and criminal organizations.  Determined, increasingly capable, and elusive enemies will use combinations of these strategies to avoid U.S. strengths, emulate advanced U.S. capabilities, disrupt U.S. advantages, and expand operations to other battlegrounds.  </p>
<p>To win across the range of military operations, Army forces must provide the Joint Force with multiple options, integrate the efforts of multiple partners, operate across multiple domains, and present enemies and adversaries with multiple dilemmas.  Army forces must have the capability (ability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and conditions) and capacity (capability with sufficient scale and endurance) to defeat enemy organizations, establish security, consolidate gains, and achieve sustainable political outcomes.</p>
<p>Understanding trends in conflict and challenging assumptions are important.  Our Army is developing design principles to guide future force development.  As you read Dr. Hoffman’s essay, consider how his ideas concerning the range, variation, and combinations of conflict apply to the F2025B Design Principles (as of 5 Jan 16), below.  </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Optimized for Warfighting - Army forces achieve overmatch, employing combinations of capabilities that prevent enemy organizations from successfully using their equipment or employing their tactics.

   

                    
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Account for accumulated risk to mission accomplishment across the Total Force.</li>
        <li>Maintain organic combinations of forces and capabilities to deal with the full range of military operations.</li>
        <li>Combine leadership, skilled soldiers, and technology through manned and unmanned teaming to reduce tactical risk and magnify capabilities.</li>
        <li>Employ dynamic combinations of conventional and special operations forces, with space and cyber capabilities to simultaneously project power across all domains.</li>
        <li>Operate dispersed while maintaining mutual support, and retaining the ability to concentrate rapidly to seize upon fleeting opportunities.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Expeditionary - Army forces have the ability to deploy task organized forces on short notice to austere locations, capable of conducting operations immediately upon arrival.  

  

                    
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Maintain capability and capacity for forward deployed operations.</li>
        <li>Transition quickly to operations of sufficient scale and ample durations.</li>
    </ol>

<li>Interoperable - Army forces partner with, use the capabilities of, and contribute to joint, interorganizational, or multinational efforts.  

  

                    
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Ensure uninterrupted mission command.</li>
        <li>Task organize rapidly and integrate efforts of joint, interorganizational, and multinational partners.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Agile - Army forces transition across the range of military operations and domains in a coordinated effort to gain positions of relative advantage.  

  

                    
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Conduct continuous reconnaissance and security operations to actively develop situational understanding.</li>
        <li>Conduct decentralized combined arms maneuver with integrated air-ground operations across land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.</li>
        <li>Secure wide areas and control territory to protect populations and consolidate gains.</li>
    </ol>

	<p>Baron Antoine-Henri Jomini in his famous study on the art of war, which attempted to identify the essentials of Napoleon's military genius, devoted many pages to the task of defining key terms such as <i class="text-primary">strategy, tactics</i>, and the like. He grasped the fundamental notion that without uniform definitions, clearly understood, the search for sound military practice is certain to be seriously flawed. Unfortunately, Jomini's good advice all too frequently has been ignored in recent years by military writers. One encounters articles equating doctrine with "the philosophy of war" while still others refer to doctrine as "concepts and principles" as if all three terms were interchangeable. This confusion even extends to such official promulgations as Joint Chiefs of Staff Publication (JCS Pub) 1, <i class="text-primary">Dictionary of US Military Terms for Joint Usage</i>, which has at one time or another identified doctrine as "a combination of principles and policies" (1949 edition) or as "fundamental principles" (1979 edition). Such definitions are at the very least confusing when not downright erroneous. There is, then, much to be gained from a concerted effort to achieve precision and uniformity when employing key military terminology.</p>

<p>Team, </p>
<p>In the December 2010 edition of Army Magazine, General Martin Dempsey described the importance of concepts stating that “They provide the intellectual foundation for how we design our Army and produce the doctrine, organizations, training, materiel, leaders, personnel and facilities to support it.”  The relationship between concepts and doctrine is often misunderstood.  In this week’s professional reading, “Concepts, Doctrine, Principles”, the late Major General I.B Holley (USAF ret.), one of the foremost military historians of the 20th century, describes the frequent misuse of the terms “concept” and “doctrine” and defines their relationship to each other.  His essay helps Army leaders understand how to drive change to ensure that future Army forces are prepared to fight, accomplish the mission, and win against capable enemies today and in future.  </p>
<p>Holley defines a concept is an “idea”, a “mental construct”, and “a picture in the brain that is eventually expressed in words”.  He explains that “concepts spring from creative imagination” and argues that this “innovation” provides an opportunity for future forces gain a differential advantage over enemies.  Doctrine, on the other hand, is derived from concepts and is the officially approved teaching.  It is “based upon accumulated experience” and provides “suggested methods for solving problems or attaining desired results”.  His essay highlights the need for doctrine to evolve based on a solid conceptual foundation for future armed conflict and a rigorous campaign of learning that evaluates and refines concepts.  </p>
<p>Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) 1-01, Doctrine Primer, http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adp1_01.pdf , advances Major General Holley’s.  ADP 1-01 states that concepts are ideas for a significant change based on proposed new approaches to the conduct of operations or technology. Concepts often propose significantly different methods the force might use in the future.  The Army evaluates concepts through a series of tests and those concepts deemed valid are incorporated into doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities solutions. Doctrine is usually the first change made to serve as a basis for integrated solutions</p>
<p>The Combined Arms Center (CAC), under the guidance of the Chief of Staff of the Army, has is rewriting our Army foundational doctrine, ADP 1, “The Army”, and will follow with a rewrite of ADP 3-0, “Unified Land Operations”.  The Army Operating Concept and our learning and analysis under the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs) are important to that effort.  To assist CAC and the Centers of Excellence with ongoing and future doctrinal updates, please post your ideas, experiences, analysis, and recommended doctrinal solutions to the AWFC MilSuite websites at the following locations:   </p>

	<p>In one of the opening scenes of the 1973 movie, The Exorcist, an older Catholic priest stands among the ruins of the ancient Mesopotamian city of Hatra. In the movie, he views an ancient statue of an Assyrian wind demon and stares directly into the stone representation of his enemy’s face. In the background, two extremely vicious dogs are fighting and the sounds of their battle appear to be coming directly from the statue as the camera closes in on its face. Clearly, a horrifying ancient evil has awakened in northern Iraq. And now, we have a modern representation of an awakened and increasingly formidable Middle Eastern evil. The evil of sectarianism.</p>

                <p>The consolidation of gains is an integral part of armed conflict and is essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies.  Because enemy organizations operate on physical battlegrounds and in other contested spaces such as perception, criminality, and political subversion, Army forces often play a supporting role in the consolidation of gains by reinforcing and integrating the efforts of multiple partners.  To consolidate gains, Army commanders must understand the cognitive, informational, social, cultural, political, and physical influences affecting human behavior and the mission.  Early and effective consolidation activities are critical to enable success and achieve lasting political outcomes in the shortest time.</p>
                <p>In this week’s reading, Dr. Andrew Terrill examines escalating sectarian violence in the Middle East.  He observes that sectarian violence in the region is not new, but it has grown dramatically stronger in recent decades.  Failing to understand the cultural drivers of violence has assisted in that escalation.  Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Iran are the two most important actors in the region and Terrill provides examples of how their sectarian competition is fueling violence.  He highlights the sectarianism of the previous regime in Iraq led by Nouri al-Maliki as an example of a cultural and political problem that was not fully understood until it led to a near collapse of the Iraqi state in the summer of 2014.  Terrill predicts that the current rise in sectarian violence could render Iraq and Syria ungovernable for decades.  </p>
                <p>Dr. Terrill’s succinct analysis of the "raw power of sectarianism" in the Middle East highlights the need for Army units to consolidate gains.  The Army Operating Concept observes that expanded leader and Soldier competencies are necessary to allow Army forces to consolidate gains in complex environments like Iraq.  Examples include support to law enforcement and financial actions for intelligence analysts, advanced situational awareness for combat arms, investigative skills for military police, reconstruction skills for engineers, rule of law advising for staff judge advocates, and institutional development for civil affairs officers and leaders within the institutional Army. Conventional and special operations forces must work together to understand, influence, or compel human behaviors.  To consolidate gains, leaders must focus beyond enemy organizations and exert influence on key individuals, organizations, and institutions through cooperative and persuasive means.  For example, when mission accomplishment requires strengthening partner institutions, Army forces exert influence to convince those partners that undertaking necessary reforms and strengthening critical institutions are in their interest. </p>
                <p>Dr. Terrill's essay has direct implications to the following Army War Fighting Challenges: </p>

			<![CDATA[

	<p>In this monograph, Dr. Tami Davis Biddle examines why it is so difficult to devise, implement, and sustain sound strategies and grand strategies. Her analysis begins with an examination of the meaning of the term “strategy” and a history of the ways that political actors have sought to employ strategies and grand strategies to achieve their desired political aims. She examines the reasons why the logic undergirding strategy is often lacking and why challenges of implementation (including bureaucratic politics, unforeseen events, civil-military tensions, and domestic pressures) complicate and undermine desired outcomes. This clear-headed critique, built on a broad base of literature (historical and modern; academic and policy-oriented), will serve as a valuable guide to students and policymakers alike as they seek to navigate their way through the unavoidable challenges—and inevitable twists and turns—inherent in the development and implementation of strategy.</p>

                <p>Team, </p>
                <p>In his 21 July 2015 testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Milley stated, "Developing strategic thinkers, planners, and leaders is one of the most important things we [the Army] do."  In “Strategy and Grand Strategy:  What Students and Practitioners Need to Know,” Dr. Tami Biddle describes difficulties in developing and implementing sound strategy and provides a framework for growing strategic leaders.</p>
                <p>Dr. Biddle argues that effective strategy “…demands a theory – a proposed causal explanation – that must stand up to rigorous analysis.”  She warns that “strategy rests on assumptions” and “if assumptions go unexamined, then one risks building a strategic edifice on a foundation of sand.”  Because war is fundamentally a continuation of policy by other means, strategy must be grounded in war’s political nature.  She recognizes the inherent uncertainty of strategy due, in part, to the roles that human will, violence, chance, and emotion play in determining the future course of events in war.  Complexities associated with communication in complex organizations, the adaptability of the enemy, stresses in civil-military relationships, and human biases complicate further the ability to develop and execute sound strategy.  To cope with the complexity of strategy Dr. Biddle recommends patience, judgment, empathy, and resilience as key attributes for strategic leaders.  Her essay reveals the centrality of studying history to developing strategic acumen and judgment.  Dr. Biddle concludes: “Diligent students of strategy will be prepared to anticipate and accommodate the inevitable twists and turns, setbacks, and disappointments they will face – and be asked to overcome.”</p>
                <p>The draft of the revised Army Leader Development Strategy (ALDS) emphasizes the need for strategic leaders to understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess operations in environments of complexity and uncertainty.  Army leaders will continue to confront complex, high stakes problems.   The Combined Arms Center (CAC) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas is finalizing the latest version of the Army Leader Development Strategy.  CAC will release the ALDS for Army-wide staffing later this month with a publication date of June 2016.

	<p>

	The desire of some US allies to rearm presents an opportunity to shore up a system of deterrence challenged by ambitious and disruptive powers. Given the nature of the threat (a limited war scenario) and the security environment of the region (A2/AD capabilities of the revisionists), frontline US allies should be armed with offensive arsenals capable of targeting our common rivals. Such a capability would strengthen not only the immediate deterrent of the individual states but also the effectiveness of American extended deterrence.

<p>Team, </p>
<p>The security environment in Europe has changed dramatically across the last decade.  Russia's increasingly aggressive behavior suggests that it is determined to expand its territory, assert its power on the Eurasian landmass, and undermine the post-Cold War security, political, and economic order in Europe.  To respond to Russian aggression, NATO is shifting from a focus on expeditionary operations to European security.  The United States European Command (USEUCOM) (
<a href="https://www.eucom.mil/media-library/document/35147/useucom-theater-strategy" target="_blank">Theater Strategy</a>) describes how Russian aggression is threatening NATO allies and partners and identifies deterring Russian aggression as the top security priority for the Command.
</p>
<p>In previous reading #53 (
<a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/LPD/professional-readings-archive.aspx?pageNo=5" target="_blank">The Case for Deterrence by Denial</a> ), Wes Mitchell argued that the evolving threat environment is not responsive to deterrence by the threat of punitive action.  This is due to the number of competitors the United States must deter, better armed rivals, limitations of  technology, new tactics for evading punitive action, and increased response times resulting from extended distances.  Mitchell argued the United States and NATO allies have an advantage in the extensive security relationships with states along the rim lands of Eurasia because those frontline states have a powerful incentive to do more for their own defense.  These alliances, their geographic locations, and motivation offer a means of “pursuing a strategy of deterrence by denial, both as an end in itself for containing growing rivals, and as a compliment to deterrence by punishment.”  Deterrence by denial limits an adversary's options and increases the immediate cost and difficulty of grabbing and holding territory.  In particular, Mitchell called for credible conventional forces, forward positioned, and capable of operating in sufficient scale and ample duration to win, should deterrence fail.  Only through a demonstrated ability to win can an alliance convince an adversary that they cannot execute low cost operations to rapidly achieve limited objectives.  Mitchell concluded that a greater focus on denial, to complement punishment capabilities, would place the psychological burden of 21st-century conflict back on shoulders of states that wish to rearrange the international order.  Similarly, the USEUCOM strategy calls for increases in forward deployed land forces to assure allies and deter further Russian aggression. These perspectives on the threat from Russia are consistent with the observation in the Army Operating Concept that:
</p>
<p>"While long-range strike and offshore capabilities will remain important to joint force operations, deterring threats from extended distance through retaliation often proves insufficient because determined adversaries attempt to achieve objectives rapidly at low cost prior to a U.S. or allied response.  Army forces communicate U.S. commitment.  Army force and their partners bolster forward defense to dissuade adversaries who are unwilling to risk direct confrontation.  Moreover, Army forces are critical to deterring conflict because they are capable of compelling outcomes without the cooperation of the enemy." (AOC, p. 16).</p>
<p>In this week’s reading, “Arming Our Allies:  The Case for Offensive Capabilities,” Jakub Grygiel argues that offensive strike capabilities strengthen a deterrence by denial strategy.  He contends that the ability to strike an aggressor on his own territory is a "necessary component of the deterrence that undergirds regional stability, strengthens local defense, and enhances US extended deterrence.”  He emphasizes that offensive capabilities in the hands of frontline Eastern European states reinforce the deterrent capabilities needed to deal with the threat of small, localized attacks by a nearby revisionist power, reinforces the credibility of American extended deterrence, and helps break the hostile anti-access/area denial 'bubble' that makes projecting power from a distance costly and difficult.  Grygiel argues for powerful combinations of forward positioned combined arms forces and offensive strike capabilities to provide credible deterrence. </p>
<p>The Artillery Systems Cooperative Activity (ASCA) initiative is an example of recent efforts to enhance the offensive strike capabilities of NATO states.  ASCA promotes the interoperability of Mission Command systems to execute digital fire missions among NATO allies.  The ASCA interface provides fire control messaging standards which consist of message formatting rules, message structure, message content, and handling rules for the data which has been transmitted.  The interface was developed alongside NATO Artillery Fire Control procedures to allow data interoperability for NATO Field Artillery systems.  By FY 17, seven NATO should be fully interoperable and able to send and receive digital fire missions.  The ASCA is one of many US Army Europe and NATO efforts to improve interoperability and strengthen deterrence based on forward deployed forces and offensive strike capabilities.  </p>

	<p>

	For military organisations, the aftermath of a war represents an opportunity to rest and refit, to think about the lessons so painfully learned and to preserve those of enduring value in education, training and doctrine. Arguably of even more importance, it is a time to reflect on and ask basic questions about the character of war: what has changed, what has remained the same, and what opportunities and challenges are suggested for the future evolution of the wars that are yet to come.

<p>Team, </p>
<p>During the Future Force Development Seminar on 29 January 2016, General Milley urged Army leaders to think clearly about the problem of future war.  Anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict.  A failure to understand war through a consideration of continuity and change risks what nineteenth century Prussian philosopher Carl von Clausewitz warned against: regarding war as “something autonomous” rather than “an instrument of policy,” misunderstanding “the kind of war on which we are embarking,” and trying to turn war into “something that is alien to its nature.”  In recent years, many of the difficulties encountered in strategic decision making, operational planning, training, and force development stemmed from neglect of continuities in the nature of war.   </p>
<p>In this week’s professional reading, “Forging Australian Land Power – A Primer,” Dr. Albert Palazzo offers a guide to “assist those tasked with thinking about the past and present to shape [the] Australian Army” into a more capable and effective force.  He  opens with a clear argument for the importance of land power and argues that, as a member of the joint force, land forces are essential to national security across a broad range of missions including: warfighting, deterrence, aid to the civil authority, peacekeeping, peace enforcement, stabilization, counter-drug trafficking, counterterrorism, counter-piracy, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief.  Palazzo uses historical examples to illustrate land forces’ essential role in achieving sustainable political outcomes in war.   He concludes, “It is the ability to prosecute close combat, or the threat to do so in peacekeeping and stabilization missions, supported by sea and air power, which guarantees that land forces will remain the final determinant in war.  Ground forces can also provide the government with the skill sets and numbers needed to cope with environmental disasters or other missions to provide aid to the civil community, but their primary purpose must remain warfighting.”   </p>
<p>Palazzo asks that the reader consider “seven truths” that underpin preparation for war:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will always be war.  This implies the need for a robust defense force with sufficient capability and capacity, which can respond to a variety of threats to the nation and its interests, in a timely manner.</li>
<li>All wars are about human will.  The human domain lies at the heart of all war and will not permit civilian and military leaders to reduce war to a science guided by unchanging precepts.  Leaders must understand and plan for the fact that war will represent the entire spectrum of human behavior and emotion.</li>
<li>Understanding a war’s context is essential.  War does not occur in isolation and must be considered as a product of its time and place.  This requires military and civilian leaders to understand the factors that shape the age in which they live in order to make the best strategic, operational, and tactical decisions.  They must consider that the character of war changes in response to technological advances, tactical innovations, variation in social, political and economic conditions, the natural genius of commanders, and the interplay between cultures.</li>
<li>Compartmentalized thinking must be recognized, challenged and discarded.  Leaders must view war as a linked conceptual whole.  Military officers must debate ideas freely in internal and external forums, without any harm to their careers if they take an institutionally unpopular stance. </li>
<li>Flexibility is the best means to counter unpredictability.  To be flexible, leaders must prepare military forces to ‘think about their alternatives as well as those of their [potential] opponents.”  </li>
<li>Military leaders and civilian decision-makers must master strategy and understand history.   Leaders must harness all available power toward the attainment governmental policy.  He emphasizes the need for leaders to use history to understand the present and inform the future. </li>
<li>Investment in leadership intellect is the most important capability improvement.  Military organizations must provide learning environments in which thinking can flourish and, most importantly, be recognized and rewarded.  The best way to prepare for future contingencies is to focus on the development of the mind.  In an era of budgetary restraint this has another benefit — good thinking is comparatively cheap and, in the long run, may even save money by improving decision-making.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dr. Palazzo’s essay highlights the need for ready land forces capable of operating with sufficient size and ample duration to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars, as well as the need for Army leaders to participate in future force development (

	<p>This paper argues that the Israelis are quite right, and that the US Army ought to take heed. The M-60 series tank, which will be the back-bone of our tank fleet for the decade to come, will proffer no clear technical advantage over Soviet tanks, and are bound to be outnumbered on any likely battlefield.</p>

            <p>As threats to U.S. national security and vital interests increase and our Army gets smaller we must develop units that are more capable to maintain overmatch against future enemies.  This week’s Professional Reading is, “How to Win Outnumbered”, by then-MG Donn Starry.  The essay is an example of how recent history can inform today’s efforts to think, learn, analyze, and implement solutions to improve the combat effectiveness of our Army.  </p>
            <p>Through a rigorous study of the Arab-Israeli conflicts of the late 1960s and early 1970s, General Starry argued that investments in the Human Dimension - training, leader development, and personnel management - could help our Army achieve overmatch through powerful combinations of leadership, skilled Soldiers, well trained teams, and technology.  Implementing the recommendations from General Starry’s study led to changes in personnel policy; the development of doctrine-based training standards and training evaluation tables for tank gunnery; the assignment of unit-level training experts through the Master Gunner’s Program; the development of instrumented gunnery ranges with the capability to conduct thorough after action reviews; and the development of technologies (such as MILES) to enhance realistic training and provide genuine performance evaluations for maneuver battalions and brigades at Combat Training Centers.  Those changes improved dramatically the combat effectiveness of our Army in the late 1970s and 1980's.</p>
            <p>Technological superiority is important, but it is the integration of advanced technologies with competent and innovative leaders, skilled Soldiers, and well-trained teams that provides the U.S. Army’s differential advantage over enemies.   Our Army’s focus on integrating Soldiers and teams with technology is not new and today’s increased technological complexity demands that Army Forces maintain a high degree of preparedness in peacetime.

	<p>War alters the behavior of states. If geopolitics is the quest for the survival of the state, then war is the tutorial that teaches states what tools they must acquire in order to survive. War rearranges the priorities of states, casting a harsh light on the utility of arrangements developed during the preceding peace. Old diplomatic alignments may suddenly seem inadequate or misbegotten; new or deeper alliances may seem urgently needful. More dramatically, the return of war to a theater that was blessed by peace for a prolonged period of time clarifies and crystallizes the military needs of the state – in two ways.</p>

        <p>Team, </p>
        <p>This March is the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Russia’s aggressive behavior, including the use of conventional and unconventional land forces in offensive operations, suggests that Russia is determined to expand its territory, assert its power on the Eurasian landmass, and challenge the post WWII security order in Europe.  Russia executed a comprehensive strategy to pursue political objectives below the threshold that would elicit a concerted North Atlantic Treaty Organization response.  Russia deployed and integrated a range of diplomatic, information, military, and economic means to conduct what some analysts have described as “non-linear” operations or “new generation warfare.”  In addition, Russia used cyberspace capabilities and social media to influence perceptions at home and abroad and provide cover for large-scale military operations. While the long-term results of the invasion of Ukraine are not yet clear, Russia demonstrated the centrality of land forces in its effort to assert power and advance its interests in former Soviet states.  Our Army is learning from the conflict in Ukraine to improve the combat effectiveness of our Joint Force.     </p>
        <p>The professional reading for this week examines Russia’s effort to undermine the post-1991 security order in Europe as well as the response of Central and Eastern European (CEE) states to that threat.  In “Frontline Allies:  War and Change in Central Europe” the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) summarizes geopolitical change in frontline Europe, examines how CEE foreign and security policies are adapting to the conditions created by the Ukraine War, and identifies implications for U.S. strategy.  In virtually every CEE member state of NATO, the Ukraine War has inspired change across a wide spectrum of military and diplomatic behaviors. The essays suggest that the new strategic landscape of Central and Eastern Europe presents an opportunity to form frontline alliances and stabilize Europe’s eastern flank.</p>
        <p>The editors organized this collection of essays in three sections.  In the first, Edward Lucas, Marcin Zaborowski and Jiří Schneider assess changes in the diplomatic behavior of frontline allies.  In the second section, Pauli Järvenpää, Thomas G. Mahnken, Andrzej Dybczyński and Ian Brzezinski examine changes in the military behavior of key allies with an emphasis on North Central Europe.  In the third section, Elbridge Colby, Chris Chivvis, Jakub Grygiel and Wess Mitchell examine options for the United States.   The study concludes that “War brings change to state behavior because it introduces something new into their environment – a threat or fear – for which they are not prepared.  In the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, war has made state violence both more likely and less winnable for members of a seemingly powerful Western alliance that have long thought it impossible.”  The study recommends:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Making frontline states less susceptible to limited war techniques</li>
            <li>Providing the tools to make those strategies viable</li>
            <li>Strengthening NATO’s ability to conduct limited nuclear war</li>
            <li>Fortifying vulnerable points in regional military geography</li>
            <li>Making territorial defense NATO’s top priority</li>
            <li>Making permanent basing the centerpiece of U.S. policy in Europe</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The findings and recommendations presented in this report imply that both capacity and capability matter in U.S. land forces.  For the past seven decades, U.S. land forces have been essential to preserving security in Europe and preventing great power conflict.  The CEPA report emphasizes the need for forward positioned land forces to deter Russian ambitions and limit Russian options.  This is a rich report.  It may seem long for a weekly reading, but is well organized and can be read quickly. </p>
        <p>The study highlights military capabilities employed by Russia and the associated need to improve capabilities of U.S. forces.  To learn from the experience in Ukraine and improve the combat effectiveness future Army forces, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, in partnership with USAREUR and organizations across our Army, has initiated a comprehensive study of the conflict.  The Russia New Generation Warfare (RNGW) Study is part of Force 2025 Maneuvers:  the physical (experimentation, evaluations, exercises, modeling, simulations, and wargames) and intellectual (studies, analysis, concept, and capabilities development) activities that help leaders integrate future capabilities and develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges.  Using the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs) as the analytical framework, the Army conducts Force 2025 Maneuvers to prioritize future force development efforts in  the near- (2014-2020), mid- (2020-2030), and far- (2030-2040) terms. The RNGW Study is led by the Infantry Commandant, Brigadier General Pete Jones.  MG Ricky Waddell is serving as senior advisor.  For more information or to contribute to the effort, contact the study chief of staff, Colonel Mark Nelson, at 757-501-6280 or mark.d.nelson.mil@mail.mil .  There has been a lot of great work done on the conflict and the RNGW Study aims, in large measure, to analyze previous studies to determine priorities for Army future force development.  </p><ul>

	Reform of an institution as large as our Army is problematic under the best of circumstances. The recent history of change in military systems of the world is instructive. Let us examine the story of Sir Swinton's invention—the tank—as well as the history of the development of concepts for mobile all-arms warfare to illustrate the challenges that would-be reformers face in trying to introduce new ideas.</p>

<p>Team, </p>
<p>This is an updated reposting of a noteworthy previous reading.  Weekly professional reading #20 is as important today as it was when it was first published in Military Review in 1983.  In his essay, General Starry noted, "The need to change will ever be with us," but he also observed that "reform of an institution as large as our Army is problematic under the best of circumstances."  To change our Army and improve landpower capabilities for

the Joint Force, General Starry identified seven key requirements:   

</p>
<ol>
<li>An institution or mechanism to identify the need for change, to draw up parameters for change, and to describe clearly what is to be done and how that differs from what has been done before.  

--That institution is Training and Doctrine Command (in partnership with many others such as AMC/RDECOM and ASA/ALT) and the mechanism is our Army's focused, sustained, and collaborative learning under Force 2025 Maneuvers as well as our research and development efforts.  Learning venues include wargames (
<a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/unified-quest.aspx" target=_blank">Unified Quest</a>), experimentation (Unified challenge), the Army's Warfighting Assessment, CTC rotations, warfighter exercises, other exercises (such as USEUCOM's Austere Challenge and  USARPAC's Pacific Pathways), and operational experiences (such as ongoing operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, and South Korea).


</li>
<li>The educational background of the principal staff and command personalities responsible for change must be sufficiently rigorous, demanding, and relevant to bring a common cultural bias to the solution of problems.  

--The Army Capabilities Integration Center gains access to expertise across our Army, the Joint Force, academia, industry,  multinational and interorganizational partners through physical (experimentation, evaluations, exercises, modeling, simulations, and wargames) and intellectual (studies, analysis, concept, and capabilities development) learning events and sustained collaboration to develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges.  The Army War College, for example, is a key partner in Unified Quest, the CSA's futures wargame.  

</li>
<li>There must be a spokesman for change. 

--The direction from General Milley is clear: readiness is our Army's priority.  To be ready to fight and win in the future, our Army must think, learn, analyze, and implement.  Army leaders developed the Army Operating Concept to provide a clear, compelling rationale for developing future force capabilities that are grounded in how Army forces must fight as part of Joint, multinational, interorganizational teams to win in a complex world.

Army leaders must clearly express ideas and future force development priorities to internal and external audiences.  TRADOC fosters common understanding of those ideas and priorities through collaboration in learning and development of products that drive innovation (e.g. AOC, Combat Vehicle Modernization Strategy, Army University charter, Human Dimension Strategy, Capabilities Needs Assessment, Robotic and Autonomy Enabled Systems Strategy).

</li>
<li>There must be consensus on the new ideas and the need to adopt them.

-- General Starry highlighted that institutional resistance and unresolved intellectual and theoretical differences contributed to delays in institutional change.

In the 1970s United States Army Training and Doctrine Command was formed, in part, to address that problem.  Today, Force 2025 and Beyond is the Army's comprehensive effort for changing the Army and improving land power capabilities for the Joint Force. It synchronizes processes and products to integrate efforts and implement change.  Force 2025 and Beyond efforts produce recommendations that help Army leaders direct modernization and force development.

</li>
<li>There must be continuity among the architects of change so that consistency of effort is brought to bear on the process.  

--Our Army is refining a sound conceptual foundation as a starting point for changes in doctrine, organizations, training, materiel, leader development and education, and personnel.  Since the publication of the AOC we have developed the long range strategies cited above as well as others including the Aviation Strategy.  We are also working collaboratively on future force design under the CSA's wargame, Unified Quest. 

</li>
<li>Someone at or near the top of the institution must be willing to hear out arguments for change, agree to the need, embrace the new operational concepts, and become at least a supporter, if not a champion, of the cause

for change.   

-- Our collaborative work under the Warfighting Challenges (see link, below) as well as the Force 2025 Board of Directors process allow TRADOC, operating as an extension of the Army staff, to frame decisions for senior leaders.  Other forums, such as the CSA monthly futures update allow the CSA to give guidance and refine opportunities to improve future force combat readiness

and effectiveness.   

</li>
<li>Changes proposed must be subjected to trials. 

--Our Army conducts rigorous experimentation, wargaming, and assessments.

Examples include Unified Quest; Unified Challenge; Bold Quest; the Deep Futures Wargame; the Innovation Symposium; Army Warfighting Assessment at Fort Bliss; the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment at Fort Benning; the Army Warfighting Challenges running estimates; Trades Analysis; and the Army's Capabilities Needs Analysis.  Last October, the inaugural Army Warfighting Assessment at Fort Bliss provided invaluable insights and recommendations that will help focus Army force development efforts in this

period of diminishing resources.  For more on this, see  
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgdZBZc4ixc " target="_blank"> BG Lee Quintas' and BG Terry McKenrick's 
<i class="fa fa-youtube fa-2x"></i> presentation
</a>  on Force 2025 Maneuvers and the Army Warfighting Assessment.   



<p>As our Army Chief of Staff, General Milley, stated: "We will do what it takes to build an agile, adaptive Army of the future.  We need to listen and learn - first from the Army itself, from the other services, from our interagency partners, but also from the private sector, and even from our critics.  Developing a lethal, professional and technically competent force requires an openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things in an increasingly complex world.  We will change and adapt."</p>
<p>As we continue our future force development efforts, please help us listen and learn.  Continue to provide your ideas, experiences, analysis, and lessons learned within the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges.</p>

having a “use” is a perfectly natural one. They would hardly have taken to historical studies if they had not held it.

<p>Team, </p>
<p>
<strong>Happy New Year.</strong>
</p>
<p>Anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict.  The character of future warfare evolves based upon changes in assigned missions; the operational environment; emerging technologies; enemy capabilities, objectives, and will. Shifts in the geopolitical landscape caused by competition for power and resources influence the character of armed conflict.  These shifts, and violence associated with them, occur more rapidly than in the past due to advances in technology, the proliferation of information, and the associated increased momentum of human interaction.  Recent and ongoing conflicts reinforce the need to balance the technological focus of defense modernization with a recognition of the limits of technology and an emphasis on the human, cultural, and political continuities of armed conflict.  Nations and organizations in the future will fight for the same reasons that the Greek historian Thucydides identified 2,500 years ago: fear, honor, and interest.   Every armed conflict exhibits some combination of violence, emotion, policy, chance, and risk. Fundamentally, war will remain a contest of wills.  Although advances in technology will continue to influence the character of warfare, the effect of technologies on land are often not as great as in other domains due to geography, the interaction with adaptive enemies, the presence of noncombatants, and other complexities associated with war’s continuities.</p>
<p>Moreover, threats to U.S. vital interests across the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains will continue to originate on land.  Land-based threats emanate from the fielded forces of hostile nation states and from areas where state weakness allows non-state enemy or adversary organizations to operate.  Conflict often arises from disorder (the breakdown of peaceful and lawful behavior).  In conflicts involving nation states, disorder often follows the defeat of enemy forces or the collapse of a regime.  Land forces are often required, therefore, to overcome the effects of this disorder through military operations that integrate joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities.  Although the ability to project power onto land from the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains will remain vital to joint operations, the employment of land forces will remain essential to achieve political outcomes.</p>
<p>One of our most important duties as Army professionals is to think clearly about the problem of future armed conflict. To help us think about continuities in the nature of war and changes in the character of armed conflict, it is hard to improve on the approach in this week’s professional reading, “The Use and Abuse of Military History,” historian Sir Michael Howard’s 1961 seminal essay.  Howard argues that military professionals should develop what Clausewitz described as their own “theory” of war.  Howard first tells us to study history in in width.  Observe how “warfare has developed over a long historical period.”  Next, Howard tells us to “study in depth.”  Study campaigns and explore them thoroughly, consulting original sources and applying various theories and interdisciplinary approaches.  This is important, Howard observes, because as the “tidy outlines dissolve,” we can “catch a glimpse of the confusion and horror of the real experience.”  And last, he tells us to “study in context.”  Wars and warfare must be understood in context of their social, cultural, economic, human, moral, political, and psychological dimensions because “the roots of victory and defeat often have to be sought far from the battlefield.”  </p>
<p>Sir Michael warns that we should not study history to make us “cleverer for the next time,” but instead to help make us “wise forever.”  Similarly, Clausewitz, observed, the study of war and warfare “is meant to educate the mind of the future commander, or, more accurately, to guide him in his self-education, not to accompany him to the battlefield; just as a wise teacher guides and stimulates a young man’s intellectual development, but is careful not to lead him by the hand for the rest of his life.”  In short, history can help military leaders ask the right questions, but leaders must consider the unique context and local realities of a particular conflict to develop answers. </p>
<p>Our Army's campaign of learning under Force 2025 Maneuvers considers the problem of future armed conflict through the lens of continuity and change in four areas: threats, missions, technology, and history and lessons learned.  Thinking clearly about future conflict is essential to the learning and analysis our Army conducts to implement future force development priorities. </p>

<p>Team, </p>
<p>Over the next two week's we are resending a few of our previous readings from 2014 and 2015. This week's readings emphasize an important theme from the last year - the importance of land forces.  To support reviewing this theme we have attached the following articles and their summaries:</p>
<ol>
<li>ARCIC Professional Reading #29 - (12 Mar 2015) - &apos;Why Do We Need An Army&apos;</li>
<li>ARCIC Professional Reading #43 - (14 Jun 2015) - &apos;8 Unique Values - Why America Needs the Army&apos;</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Professional Reading #29:</strong>
</p>
<p>This week's professional reading is an AUSA position paper from 1973 titled 
<a href="../App_Documents/AUSA_PositionPaper_Why-Do-We-Need-An-Army_17SEP1973.pdf">Why Do We Need An Army  </a>. The authors argue that the military posture of the United States must be sufficient to support US National Policy in all situations against all reasonable threats.  They also argue that land forces are essential to national defense for both their ability to deter war and, if necessary, wage war.  
</p>
<p>Written more than 40 years later, the Army Operating Concept reflects great similarities to this AUSA paper.  Like the AUSA paper, the AOC recognizes that American military power is joint power and that balanced Joint Force capabilities create synergy and provide the President, Secretary of Defense, and combatant commanders with multiple options to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars.  However, also like the AUSA paper, the AOC makes clear:</p>
<ul id="ListItems">
<li>War will remain a contest of wills fought by people who inhabit land. </li>
<li>Threats to U.S. vital interests across the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains originate on land. </li>
<li>The employment of land forces is essential to achieve political outcomes.</li>
<li>The diversity of threats to U.S. security and vital interests will increase the need for Army forces to prevent conflict and shape security environments.</li>
<li>Army forces communicate U.S. commitment. </li>
<li>Army forces are critical to deterring conflict because they are capable of compelling outcomes without the cooperation of the enemy.</li>
<li>In the complex future operating environment and while operating against hybrid enemies, Army forces will be essential for projecting national power through support for diplomatic, political, law enforcement, development, and other efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AUSA paper concludes that "diplomacy and military strength are not competing approaches in our pursuit of peace - they are part and parcel of our common approach to achieve détente."  Here, the Army Operating Concept is wholly consistent.</p>

<strong>Professional Reading #43:</strong>
</p>
<p>Team,</p>
<p>The professional reading for this week is "8 Unique Values: Why America Needs the Army" by Loren Thompson.  This article was published in the September 2014 issue of 
<a href="http://www.armymagazine.org/2014/08/14/8-unique-values-why-america-needs-the-army/" target="_blank">Army Magazine</a>
</p>
<p>Thompson recounts our nation's history of reducing the size of the Army after periods of war.  He argues that reducing the size of the Army beyond the point of acceptable risk may stem from a misunderstanding of the importance of land forces to American joint military power.  Army leaders understand that, in our democracy, we get the Army that the American people are willing to pay for and it is our job to provide the best force we can with the resources we are allocated.  However, Army leaders must also be prepared to provide best military advice on what is needed to maintain an effective balance of manpower, readiness, and modernization.  Our most senior leaders have done just that, but we must all be prepared to reinforce their explanation and engage in conversations on this topic with our civilian leaders and interested fellow citizens.  Thompson's essay is consistent with the Army Operating Concept -- leaders might reread chapters 2 and 3 to review the argument for ready land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and for ample duration to accomplish the mission in future armed conflict. 
<a href="http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/tp525-3-1.pdf">The AOC</a>  is also an excellent beach reading. 
</p>
<p>Reading Thompson's essay and the AOC may call into question implicit assumptions that result in an undervaluing of ready land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and for ample duration to deter war and accomplish the mission in future armed conflict.   Because those assumptions are implicit, risk associated with them goes unaccounted and may be mounting based on recent events and developments that threaten US national and international security.  Based on the public discourse on defense it seems that the following are some of those assumptions:</p>
<ul id="ListItems">
<li>that the Joint Force and interorganizational partners can solve complex political-military problems from standoff range.</li>
<li>that a narrow range of military technologies are "decisive" in war </li>
<li>that technology can substitute for capacity (i.e. size), especially capacity in ready land forces. </li>
<li>that partners will be reliable, possessing both the capability and will to act consistent with U.S. national interests. </li>
<li>that consolidation of gains is not an inherent aspect of armed conflict. </li>
<li>that ad hoc joint teams can 'aggregate' and 'disaggregate' without losing combat effectiveness. </li>
<li>that a sanitary form of 'power projection,' rather than fighting under chaotic and uncertain conditions, is what the Joint Force does to respond to and resolves crises. </li>
<li>that deterrence comes from stand-off capabilities or the application of overwhelming firepower rather than forward deterrence and the ability to deny an enemy even limited objectives. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thompson's eight unique values of Army forces align very closely with our Army Core Competencies of:  Shape the Security Environment, Set the Theater, Project National Power, Combined Arms Maneuver, Wide Area Security, Cyberspace operations, and Special Operations.  </p>

                                                                                                                                                                    <p>In the Preface to the Army Operating Concept, General David Perkins emphasizes an important duty as Army professionals “to think clearly about the problem of future armed conflict.”  Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work and General Paul Selva recently argued that “successfully navigating through [the] complex and dynamic competitive environment will … require us to push the boundaries of technology while ensuring that innovation remains rooted in operationally realistic doctrine and capabilities.  One way to do both is to re-prime and re-stoke the department’s wargaming engine.”  To ensure that future Army forces are prepared to prevent conflict, shape the security environment, and win wars, Army leaders develop and mature concepts for future armed conflict; assess concepts in wargames, experimentation, and other learning activities; and use what is learned to drive future force development.  In short we must think clearly about future war; learn about the demands of future armed conflict; analyze what we learn to develop integrated solutions; and implement those solutions to maintain overmatch against increasingly capable enemies.    </p>

Our professional reading this week describes how wargaming can help us learn and apply what we learn to future force development. In “Gaming the System of Systems,” Robert P. Haffa, Jr., and James H. Patton, Jr. review historical contributions of wargaming and describe how conflict simulations remain important to future force development.  The authors argue that “strategic thinking and wargaming conducted during times of peace can produce significant advantages in subsequent conflicts.”  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                    <p>The authors warn that “the value of wargames … will decline if we become complacent and intellectually formulaic in our gaming and do not retest traditional assumptions.  They also caution that we should not expect wargaming to provide the “relative goodness” of a specific system, or an answer on how to defeat a particular enemy.  They emphasize keys to successful wargaming consistent with our Army's efforts under Unified Quest (the CSA's wargame) and Unified Challenge (Army experimentation):</p>

    As we enter the New Year, our Army will conduct a series of Unified Quest (UQ) wargames.  Unified Quest is the Chief of Staff of the Army’s primary mechanism for exploring the future and deep future
                                                                                                                                                                        <br>

UQ helps leaders understand what missions Army forces must accomplish against future enemies and in future operating environments as well as how Army forces will fight and conduct operations to accomplish those missions.  Ultimately, UQ allows leaders to identify the doctrinal, organizational, training, leader development, material, policy, personnel and facilities implications of future war.  UQ considers threats, enemies, and adversaries in future operating environments; future missions; emerging technologies; and enduring lessons of recent and ongoing conflicts.   UQ is designed for cumulative learning in a series of wargames, seminars, and analytical studies.  UQ wargames help leaders identify the capabilities our Army must possess in the future and assess the projected force mix, force design, and Total Army capacity required for future Army forces to accomplish the mission as part of joint, interorganizational, and multinational teams.  This year UQ will define future roles, functions, and tasks of every echelon of command, from platoon to theater army (mainly during a seminar in January 2016); design future organizations; and assess those organizations during the UQ 2016 capstone wargame at the US Army War College in May.

	<p>The history of our Guard has been around since 1636. I don't have to tell you that. You know it. And you are charted to protect and defend our great nation, even before we were a nation. And it does my heart good to sit here in the great State of Tennessee to know that the United States National Guard was regimented as infantry and artillery with the purpose of defending the great Colony of

Massachusetts.

                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Team, </p>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Today we celebrate our Army National Guard’s 379th birthday.  On December 13, 1636, the Massachusetts General Court established that all able-bodied men between the ages of 16 and 60 were required to join the militia.  While much has changed since 1636, the National Guard remains a cornerstone of our national defense.  Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen deploy and fight in support of our national interests, serve the people of their states, respond to natural disasters, and train to achieve the highest standards of readiness to be prepared to help our Army win in a complex world.  And our National Guard is essential to ensuring that our military remains connected to our citizens in whose name we serve and fight.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Due to increasing commitments overseas and reductions in the size of our Army, the pool of ready land forces prepared to deploy rapidly and transition quickly into operations is at a historic low.  And threats to national and international security are increasing.  Celebrating our National Guard’s birthday presents an opportunity to consider how growing threats, reductions in the size of our Army, and constrained resources for readiness and modernization increase the urgency of strengthening the synergistic and interdependent relationship between the three components of the Total Force (Active Component, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve).  Our Army’s three components accentuate one another’s relative strengths and compensate for one another's limitations.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>In this week’s professional reading, Chief of Staff of the Army, General Mark Milley highlights the importance of the Total Force in his address to the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS) on 11 September, 2015.  Emphasizing that it is impossible for America to go to war today without the Reserve Component, he stated, “We are, in fact, one Army.  We have three components, but it's one Army.”  He identified three major efforts for our Total Army:</p>
                                                                                                                                                                            <ul id="ListItems">
                                                                                                                                                                                <li>Build readiness across the Total Force through modernization, Soldier training, and leader development.</li>
                                                                                                                                                                                <li>Design the Army so it has sufficient capacity to support the Joint Force Commander and win decisively on land and across the range of military operations and missions.

	</li>
                                                                                                                                                                                <li>Maintain our operational and tactical overmatch against our adversaries.

	</li>
                                                                                                                                                                            </ul>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>General Milley concluded his remarks by stating we must “collectively challenge how we organize, how we train, [and] how we equip” to maximize readiness.  He asked four questions:

                                                                                                                                                                            <ul id="ListItems">
                                                                                                                                                                                <li>What is the right number of annual training days for National Guard Soldiers and units?</li>
                                                                                                                                                                                <li>Can the use of roundout units make the Army more effective? </li>
                                                                                                                                                                                <li>What changes to individual assignment policies increase individual readiness and allow Soldier and leader development?</li>
                                                                                                                                                                                <li>What options help the National Guard increase and sustain unit readiness, including more rotations at the combat training centers?</li>
                                                                                                                                                                            </ul>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>In his closing comments, General Milley stated, “I want you to have a spirit of innovation and inquiry. And I don't want you to just accept the status quo ante. I want you to get after it, take a look at it, figure out ways to improve, whether it's technology or equipment, training methods, systems, you name it.”  We are working across all components to deliver answers to General Milley's questions under Force 2025 Maneuvers, our Army's campaign of learning.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Force 2025 Maneuvers are the physical (experimentation, evaluations, exercises, modeling, simulations, and wargames) and intellectual (studies, analysis, concept, and capabilities development) activities that help leaders integrate future capabilities and develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges. Using the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs) as the analytical framework, the Army conducts Force 2025 Maneuvers to develop concepts, operational and organizational plans, DOTMLPF solutions, leader and Soldier assessment tools, and policy solutions to achieve the vision of the Army’s force in the near- (2014-2020), mid- (2020-2030), and far- (2030-2040) terms. Force 2025 Maneuvers allows the Army to translate big ideas (such as changes to reserve component training days, formation of round-out units, ways to improve readiness, and new individual assignment policies) into integrated, concrete actions to improve the future force.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>Related initiatives include a General Officer Working Group consisting of representatives from all three components to identify opportunities to optimize component regional and mission alignment, grow capacity through multicomponent units, enhance reserve component readiness and mobilization processes, and identify innovative personnel management initiatives.  Some of that work was summarized in Total Force Panels at this year’s National Guard Association of the United States and Association of the United States Army annual conventions.  This year's Capabilities Needs Assessment (our Army's process for identifying future force development priorities) includes several Total Force recommendations.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>As General Milley indicated, improving the combat effectiveness of our Army is dependent upon broad collaboration across the Army.  Focused and sustained collaboration across all components is a feature of our work under the Warfighting Challenges.  Please contribute your insights and perspective on the CSA's four questions within the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges.  The following AWFCs are most relevant:</p>
                                                                                                                                                                            <p>For more information on the birthday the National Guard please visit the following website:  http://www.nationalguard.mil/Features/2015/379thBirthday.aspx  </p>

	<p>Unlike Soviet propaganda, Russia’s information warfare does not crudely promote the Kremlin’s agenda. Instead it is calibrated to confuse, befuddle and distract. In the words of Peter Pomeranzev and Michael Weiss, modern Russia has weaponized information, turning the media into an arm of state power projection. Their nihilistic approach is best summed up by the motto of the Kremlin’s premier TV arm, RT (formerly Russia Today): “Question more.” Russian disinformation does not aim to provide answers, but to provoke doubt, disagreement and, ultimately, paralysis.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                <p>Team, </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The Army Operating Concept (AOC) emphasizes how Army forces must cope with the increasing velocity of human interaction and the speed at which information diffuses globally through multiple mediums. Access to information allows organizations to mobilize people and resources locally, regionally, and globally. Disinformation and propaganda drive violence in support of political objectives.  To present enemies and adversaries with multiple dilemmas, the AOC introduced the term Joint Combined Arms Operations, an expansion of the traditional concept of combined arms to include the integration of not only joint capabilities, but also the broad range of efforts necessary to accomplish the mission.  Army forces have to operate not just on physical battlegrounds, but across all battlegrounds and contested spaces.  Those include battlegrounds of perception and political subversion.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                <p>In the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) Infowar Paper No. 1 "Information Warfare:  What Is It and How to Win It", Edward Lucas and Ben Nimmo describe Russia’s disinformation campaign to "erode public support for Euro-Atlantic values" and "impede and distort U.S. and European decision-making."  Lucas and Nimmo emphasize that the "overall aim of these propaganda efforts is to undermine a rules-based multilateral security order in Europe that Russia regards as unfair and unsustainable. Russia believes it is entitled to a 'grey zone' along its borders in which other nations’ sovereignty is constrained and in which it enjoys privileged economic and political status. It regards the post-1989 settlement as both deplorable and temporary. It sees democracies and open societies as a threat: they may infect Russia."  They observe that Russian disinformation efforts are increasing in sophistication, intensity, reach, and impact.  They cite Russian actions in Crimea as an example of using rhetoric to exploit the protest potential of populations as a prelude for a land-grab.  The authors identify similar potential target populations in Narva, Estonia and Daugavpil, Latvia and in capital cities such as Tallinn, Estonia and Riga, Latvia.  They warn that "If Europe and North America do not urgently respond to this challenge, the West risks increasing public discontent, ill-informed decision-making, the rise of radical challengers, setbacks in the front-line states and a fatal blow to Euro-Atlantic solidarity."   Examining the 'weaponization' of information by enemies and adversaries such as Russia's "carefully orchestrated, sophisticatedly targeted, and generously funded" disinformation campaign to "provoke doubt, disagreement, and paralysis," is the first step toward ensuring that future Army forces are prepared to fight and win on the battleground of perception.  Lucas and Nimmo conclude that "the West's response to Russia's weaponized information is still in its infancy.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                <p>But the battle is worth fighting."  Tenets identified in the AOC are meant to help commanders think about how best to align efforts in time, space, and purpose to accomplish objectives.  Lucas and Nimmo's paper is consistent with the tenet of simultaneity that "extends efforts beyond physical battlefields into other contested spaces such as public perception, political subversion, illicit financing, and criminality."   A recent Unified Quest seminar focused on how to improve Army force's ability to clarify intentions; counter enemy disinformation and propaganda; expose enemy criminality and brutality; isolate enemies from popular support; and bolster the legitimacy of partners.  A report is forthcoming.  Several Army Warfighting Challenges are relevant to this week's reading, especially Warfighting Challenge 2: How to shape and influence security environments, engage key actors, and consolidate gains to achieve sustainable security outcomes in support of Geographic and Functional Combatant Commands and Joint requirements.</p>

	<p>On 9 April 2003, jubilant crowds and US troops toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad and drew down the curtain on the major combat phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Within hours of the liberation of Baghdad, amid spreading disorder and growing expectations, debate began over the reconstruction challenges ahead. Criticism and frustration with the chaos on the ground intensified over the apparent failure of the United States to plan adequately for the restoration of political and economic order once major combat operations had ended.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>Team, </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>In a recent white paper authored by the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School/Special Operations Center of Excellence, MG James Linder noted that, "One of the repeated lessons of Operations ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) and IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), as well as the many peacetime operations of the 1990s, is that military forces operating abroad must be prepared…to help build partner governance capacity.” His observation is very consistent with the Army Operating Concept (AOC):  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>“The consolidation of gains is an integral part of armed conflict and is essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies and adversaries. Enemy organizations operate on physical battlegrounds and in other contested spaces such as perception, criminality, and political subversion. To consolidate gains, Army forces often play a supporting role by reinforcing and integrating the efforts of multiple partners. For example, Army units provide military support to governance, rule of law, and law enforcement. Expanded leader and Soldier competencies allow Army forces to consolidate gains in complex environments. Examples include support to law enforcement and financial actions for intelligence analysts, advanced situational awareness for combat arms, investigative skills for military police, reconstruction skills for engineers, rule of law advising for staff judge advocates, and institutional development for civil affairs officers and leaders within the institutional Army. Conventional and special operations forces work together to understand, influence, or compel human behaviors and perceptions. Army commanders understand cognitive, informational, social, cultural, political, and physical influences affecting human behavior and the mission. Leaders exert influence on key individuals, organizations, and institutions through cooperative and persuasive means. For example, when mission accomplishment requires strengthening partner institutions, Army forces exert influence to convince those partners that undertaking necessary reforms and strengthening critical institutions are in their interest. Emphasis on early and effective consolidation activities as a fundamental part of campaign design enables success and achieves lasting favorable outcomes in the shortest time span.”</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>In this week’s reading, “War and the Art of Governance,” Dr. Nadia Schadlow demonstrates that the need to consolidate gains in Afghanistan and Iraq was consistent with the American military experience from the Mexican War to our most recent conflicts.  She argues persuasively that to achieve sustainable and lasting political outcomes in future conflicts, leaders must consider the establishment of political and economic order as a part of war itself.   The need to consolidate gains has profound implications for planning, command relationships, and organization. She observes that “combat operations and governance operations are both integral to war and occur in tandem.”  Her observations hold true as the US and coalition partners plan to defeat ISIL and restore enduring security and stability to the territory and people under the control of a terrorist proto-state.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>Dr. Schadlow’s analysis reveals observations relevant to joint doctrine, defense planning, and future force development:</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>Team, </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>In his 21 July, 2015 confirmation hearing testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Milley stated that "the U.S. Army must be lethal, agile, adaptive, innovative, and expeditionary; armed with leader, technological and training overmatch." He urged us to "train and educate our leaders to operate effectively in the spectrum of conflict against multiple conflict forms."  He emphasized that "developing strategic thinkers, planners, and leaders is one of the most important things we do, and is grounded in the best possible training, education, and experiences." </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>Leader development is fundamental to our Army's ability to fight and win today and in the future.  As the Army Operating Concept observes and LTG Bob Brown often reminds us, our Army needs leaders who thrive under conditions of uncertainty and persistent danger.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>In this week's articles, General James Mattis (USMC retired) and Major Joe Byerly stress the importance of professional reading and self-study as part military leader development. </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>In the first reading, Gen. Mattis, in an email response to a colleague, observed that "by reading, you learn through others' experiences, generally a better way to do business, especially in our line of work where the consequences of incompetence are so final for young men."   Gen. Mattis stated that "Thanks to my reading, I have never been caught flat-footed by any situation, never at a loss for how any problem has been addressed (successfully or unsuccessfully) before. It doesn't give me all the answers, but it lights what is often a dark path ahead." </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>In our second article written in support of the Atlantic Council's "Art of Future Warfare" project, Major Joe Byerly argues that a professional reading program focused solely on non-fiction is insufficient and that a balanced professional reading program must also include fiction.  He argues that classic literature, historical fiction, and science fiction introduces military leaders to new and abstract concepts.  Byerly observes that fiction can help us understand the human condition.  And storytelling in fiction helps us retain what we learn.  Fiction, especially science fiction, can help us think about problems in different ways, imagine, and innovate.  As former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey observed:  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>"By provoking us to free our minds of constraint and convention, worthy science fiction allows us to create a mental laboratory of sorts. In this place, we can consider new problems we might soon face or contemplate novel ways to address old problems. It sparks the imagination, engenders flexible thinking, and invites us to explore challenges and opportunities we might otherwise overlook."</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>Fiction also provides an important perspective on war and warriors. Fiction helps us understand the existential demands that war makes on those who fight and the importance of qualities such as courage, self-sacrifice and honor, as well as the rewards of service in wartime associated with comradeship and fulfilling one's sense of duty. Readers realize that war is shaped by human impulses, dreams, weaknesses, and often peoples' surprising strength.  In fiction, characters reveal the human dimension of war.  Fiction allows readers to consider what their favorite characters might do under certain circumstances.  As Christopher Coker observed in his superb book on military fiction, "Men at War: What Fiction Tells Us About Conflict, from The Iliad to Catch-22", an engaged reader becomes a co-author and can live through characters of fiction by willingly entering their world.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>Gen. Mattis and Major Byerly make clear that reading and thinking broadly about war and warriors can help Army leaders think more clearly about future war and their responsibilities.  Self-study, along with professional military education and experience, is critical to the development of innovative and adaptive leaders who think critically, assess situations continuously, develop innovative solutions to problems, accept prudent risk, and remain mentally and physically agile to capitalize on opportunities.</p>

	<p>Ever since my developmental switch “flipped” a few years ago and the pursuit of knowledge became a critical aspect of my professional identity as a U.S. Army officer, I’ve devoured the books on the various reading lists I’ve come across. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize I was doing myself a disservice. My reading was akin to an unbalanced diet too rich in protein. I was consuming a lot of nonfiction, while fiction was absent from my plate – a very valuable source of professional growth. </p>

	<p>There is a famous story attributed to Albert Wohlstetter and Andrew Marshall about a medieval knight. The knight finds a modern assault rifle with a bayonet on the battlefield. Clearly, the weapon offers greater range and lethality than anything the knight has. Yet, what does the knight do with it? Does he use it to bludgeon his adversaries as he would a sword or does he experiment, firing the rifle at targets over a hundred yards away, and realize the potential for new forms of warfare? Without experimentation and a vibrant intellectual discourse on the future of land warfare, the United States risks becoming the bludgeoning knight. This experimentation should include, but must not be limited to the pursuit of new technologies.</p>

In their essay, “How the U.S. Army Remains the Master of Landpower,” Colonel Paul Norwood and Major Ben Jensen observe that defense innovation initiatives and off-set strategies must focus beyond the pursuit of breakthrough technologies.  Norwood and Jensen point out that innovation requires solutions that integrate doctrinal change, organizational design, improvements in training and leader development, personnel and human dimension considerations, and policy changes.   Consistent with how our Army is designing the future force, change must begin with well-developed operational and organizational concepts that consider threats enemies and adversaries in the future operating environment; future missions; emerging technology; and history/lessons learned.    The authors propose a framework for developing holistic, joint capabilities through a coherent framework of wargaming, experiments and exercises.  Their framework is consistent with and will help inform our efforts to learn and conduct rigorous analysis under Force 2025 Maneuvers, our Army's campaign of learning.  </p>

	<p>It’s a great honor to be invited to testify again before this august committee and its distinguished members. It is also encouraging to know that in a time of decreasing attention spans and in a political climate increasingly focused on “winning the news cycle”, members of both parties are taking seriously the long-term strategic planning needs of the Republic. My aim today will be to clarify the geopolitical situation we face in the early 21st century, the challenges and opportunities that are likely to arise going forward, and the grand strategy concerns of the United States that derive from these.</p>

The world is increasingly complex, in part, because we are competing with a broad range of increasingly capable enemies and adversaries who threaten national and international security.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>As the Army Operating Concept states, "threats, enemies, and adversaries are becoming increasingly capable and elusive. State and nonstate actors employ traditional, unconventional, and hybrid strategies that threaten U.S. security and vital interests. The complexity of future armed conflict is due to increasing momentum of human interaction, threats emanating from dense and weakly governed urban areas, the availability of lethal weapon systems, and the proliferation of CBRNE threats. Enemies and adversaries will challenge U.S. competitive advantages in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains. Advanced technologies will transfer readily to state and nonstate actors. Enemies possess the capability to threaten the U.S. homeland and project power from land into all other domains. Because these threats may originate in dense urban areas or remote safe havens, long-range strikes will prove insufficient to defeat them. The complexity of future armed conflict, therefore, will require Army forces capable of con

	conducting missions in the homeland or in foreign lands including defense support of civil authorities, international disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, security cooperation activities, crisis response, or large-scale operations."

                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>As General Milley stated last month, “We will do what it takes to build an agile, adaptive Army of the future. We need to listen and learn - first from the Army itself, from other services, from our interagency partners, but also from the private sector, and even from our critics. Developing a lethal, professional and technically competent force requires an openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things in an increasingly complex world.  We will change and adapt.”  This week’s professional reading provides an opportunity to think about how Army forces might contribute more to national security and defense strategy to cope with emerging threats to national and international security.   In recent testimony to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, Professor Walter Russell Mead provided his thoughts on “Global Challenges, U.S. National Security, and 




Defense Organization" (please see attached or go to:  http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/download/mead_10-22-15).  In his written statement, Mead argues that Americans need the benefits of a stable world order to be safe and prosperous at home.   Maintaining an open global economic system and preserving a stable geopolitical order are vital to continued American prosperity.  He recommends that American foreign policy and national security strategy aim to maintain, defend, extend and improve the international system in the 21st century.   In contrast to pessimistic predictions of U.S. decline, Mead highlights enduring political, economic, geographical, and social sources of American strength.  He also emphasizes the unprecedented network of alliances that gives the United States unmatched global reach to promote stability and prosperity in the face of 21st century diplomatic, economic and security challenges.

                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>--Innovate and maintain overmatch to be ready for tomorrow.   The United States needs to keep upping its game, reforming its institutions, improving its strategies, and otherwise preparing itself to address more complex and challenging issues—often at a faster 

	pace than before, and with higher penalties for getting things wrong.

He argues that "the international security system promoted by the United States is based on two principles, alliance and deterrence."  Meade is concerned that deterrence is less valued today than it should be.  As the AOC observes, "Army forces have long been essential to preventing conflict through the forward positioning or rotation of forces overseas.  Regionally engaged Army forces are needed to build partner capability, assure allies, and deter adversaries.  While long range strike and offshore capabilities will remain important to joint force operations, deterring threats from extended distance through retaliation often proves insufficient because determined adversaries attempt to achieve objectives rapidly at low cost prior to a U.S. or allied response.  Army forces communicate U.S. commitment.  Army forces and their partners bolster forward defense to dissuade adversaries who are unwilling to risk direct confrontation.  Moreover, Army forces are critical to deterring conflict because they are capable of compelling outcomes without the cooperation of the enemy." </p>

<p>First published in 1999 in the Naval War College Review, this article is republished

unchanged here as an example of how geopolitical reasoning can be used to make predictions about

the future. The article first reviews the development and critique of classical geopolitics, defending it

as a legitimate approach to understanding international relations, and then uses geopolitics as a lens

to predict trends in the world of the twenty-first century.

                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>Since World War II, the prosperity and security of the United States have depended, in large measure, on the synergistic effects of capable land, air, and maritime forces.  U.S. defense strategy requires ready land forces (Army, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Forces) capable of operating as part of joint teams in sufficient scale and for ample duration to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and create multiple options for responding to and resolving crises. As the nation’s principal land force, the U.S. Army organizes, trains, and equips forces for prompt and sustained combat.  Army forces are necessary to defeat enemy organizations, control terrain, secure populations, consolidate gains, and preserve joint force freedom of movement and action.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>In this week’s ARCIC professional reading, “In Defense of Classical Geopolitics,” an essay published in 1999 (and republished in the current issue of Orbis), Dr. Mackubin T. Owens argues that "the most important influence on strategy making is geography, the physical setting of human activity, whether political, economic, or strategic."  Dr. Owens observes that "there are many subdivisions of geography, but those of greatest interests to statesmen and strategists are variants of human geography, which studies the ways in which physical factors interact with population, political institutions, culture, communications, industry, and technology."   Owens summarizes the research and theories of important geostrategists, refuting what had become a popular assertion at the time that geography is less important in the post-Cold War era than before.  In comparing the importance of geography to other factors such as technology and economics, Owens acknowledges interdependencies, but argues convincingly that neither technological advances nor economic development are as important as geography.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>Dr. Owens identified the following post-Cold War strategic implications.  They appear particularly prescient given recent history and ongoing events:</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>-   The geographical correlation of power, the identification of core areas, and the relationship between maritime and continental capabilities will continue to shape U.S. policy and strategy.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>-   The overarching strategic imperative of the United States will continue to be preventing the rise of a hegemon capable of dominating the Eurasian continental realm and of challenging the United States in the maritime realm.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

-   Future American regional strategic priorities will resemble those of the past.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

-	The United States should maintain sufficient land power to influence Europe and East Asia, keeping in mind that it cannot be a land power beyond North America without also being a sea power. 

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

-	NATO should be expanded in order to firmly anchor Mitteleuropa to the maritime realm. This is important because, detached from Western Europe, the region of Central and Eastern Europe may revert to its traditional role as a shatterbelt (areas distinguished by their fragmented political and economic character).  This is also true of the Balkans. 

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

-	There are limits to improved relations between the United States and Russia and between the United States and China.  Neither NATO nor the United States-Japan relationship should be sacrificed based on the hope or expectation of an entente with Russia or China.

 </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

-	Concerns about drugs, environmental degradation, migration, and economic chaos in Africa and South America-the quarter-sphere of strategic marginality-should not divert the United States from its perennial overarching strategic goal of preventing the rise of a Eurasian hegemon. 

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

-	Space, distance, and the fact that South Asia is an independent geopolitical region limit the ability of the United States to affect directly the emerging India-Pakistan arms race. 

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

-	Because of oil and strategic location, the Middle East shatterbelt will continue to be a zone of turmoil.  Without a strategic U.S. presence, this turmoil could spread to affect the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean in one direction and Central Asia in another.

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

Understanding geopolitics is essential for senior leaders to provide their best advice at the strategic level.  Dr. Owens concludes his essay with three points:  

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

-- Geopolitics is not geographic determinism but geography does define limits and opportunities in international politics.

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

--Geopolitics is dynamic, not static. 

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>

--Geopolitics clarifies the range of strategic choices, providing a guide for achieving strategic efficiency.  

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The essay is also available at this link.  https://www.usnwc.edu/Publications/Naval-War-College-Review/ArchivedIssues/1990s/1999-Autumn-.aspx </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>As the AOC observes, "recent and ongoing conflicts reinforce the need to balance the technological focus of Army modernization with a recognition of the limits of technology and an emphasis on the human, cultural, and political continuities of armed conflict. Nations and organizations in the future will fight for the same reasons that the Greek historian Thucydides identified 2,500 years ago: fear, honor, and interest. Every armed conflict exhibits some combination of violence, emotion, policy, chance, and risk. Fundamentally, war will remain a contest of wills. Although advances in technology will continue to influence the character of warfare, the effect of technologies on land are often not as great as in other domains due to geography, the interaction with adaptive enemies, the presence of noncombatants, and other complexities associated with war’s continuities."</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>For more on geopolitics, see the April 2015 issue of Orbis at http://www.fpri.org/orbis

	<p>ISIS, or the Islamic State (IS) as it now calls itself, is a far deadlier enemy than Al Qaeda, especially in its understanding and use of Information Warfare and Psychological Operations (PSYOP). </p><p>A fully fledged insurgency which has recruited tens of thousands of fighters and controls large parts of Iraq and Syria, IS is especially skilled in the exploitation of global social media networks to radicalize, indoctrinate and recruit. 

</p><p>While the use of force-such as airstrikes-against IS targets may have a positive effect in the short term, victory in the long term will only come when the “lifestyle of the jihadi” is effectively delegitimized. This will require America to draft and execute a national-level Information Operations campaign against the Islamic State. Currently the true center of gravity of this group lies in its Threat Doctrine of Global Jihadism. That ideology cannot be destroyed kinetically.

War remains fundamentally a contest of wills and enemies will continue to develop and employ sophisticated strategies to operate beyond physical battlegrounds and advance their efforts on the battlegrounds of information, perception, and political subversion.  To seize, retain and exploit the initiative as well as consolidate military gains, Army forces must understand how threats, enemies, and adversaries fight on the battleground of perception and use that understanding to clarify our intentions, counter enemy disinformation, discredit the enemy (often by exposing enemy brutality and criminality), and bolster the legitimacy of our partners.    </p>

Army commanders understand cognitive, informational, social, cultural, political, and physical influences affecting human behavior and the mission.  Leaders exert influence on key individuals, organizations, and institutions through cooperative and persuasive means."  These efforts must be "a fundamental part of campaign design."</p>

In “The Islamic State and Information Warfare: Defeating ISIS and the Broader Global Jihadist Movement”, Editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka pulled together four important essays that:</p>

	  Gorka and the contributors make clear that defeating ISIS on the physical battlefield is necessary but insufficient to win.  Winning requires a strategy that combines physical and psychological activities to deny the enemy the ability to influence the perceptions and behaviors of relevant populations and governments. 

            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </ol>

Joint combined arms operations allows joint force commanders to operate consistent with the tenet of initiative, dictating the terms of operations and rendering the enemy incapable of responding effectively.  Additionally, consistent with the tenet of simultaneity, Army forces present the enemy with multiple dilemmas to overwhelm them psychologically as well as physically.  </p>

			The Army has entered a period of self-reflection that has already led to new behaviors, processes and institutions. This kind of reflection happens after every war: a time to look back at wartime experiences, assess what the Army did well and what it did not do so well, and adjust based upon whatever future the Army foresees. There are two problems with this current period, however: The war is not over, and war itself is changing in fundamental ways.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>In this week’s professional reading, “Wake Up, America, to a Strategic New World,” LTG James Dubik, US Army retired, notes that our Army has entered a period of self-reflection that is driving important changes.  He observes, however, that our ability to reflect is challenged because we are still at war and the character of warfare is evolving.  He describes strategies in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the ongoing counter-terrorism effort as defensive.  He argues that defensive strategies cannot win and predicts that eventually, due either to enemy action or our own realization, U.S. Joint Forces will have to expand operations against enemies and adversaries to secure vital US national interests. </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>Dubik argues that the AOC's observation that wars are won at the strategic level should be developed further.  Because of a shift in the character of armed conflict in which "super empowered” non-state groups and people influence the outcome, military force is necessary but insufficient to win.  It is the integration of all elements of power that is decisive.  Dubik concludes that changes in the character of war challenge the Army to understand its role in decisions to wage war and decisions concerning how to fight.  His article challenges Army leaders to think about the enduring nature of war as well as the changing character of armed conflict to ensure that we are prepared to provide our best military advice and direct military efforts toward achieving sustainable outcomes consistent with our vital interests.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The Army Operating Concept is the starting point for thinking about future armed conflict, learning, analyzing what we learn, and implementing change to ensure that our Army is prepared to win in a complex world.  General Dubik criticizes the AOC because it "less than fully developed the Army’s challenges and functions at the strategic, war-waging level." General Dubik's article is a great example of how to use the AOC as a departure point to grow our expert knowledge -- a pillar of our Army profession.  And General Dubik, across his career and after retirement, provides a sterling example of how leaders can contribute to professional knowledge through writing.  His essay highlights the importance of education across all three domains (institutional, experience, and self-study) to develop strategic competencies in Army leaders.  It is consistent with the need for strategic planning to consider the consolidation of gains as: "an integral part of armed conflict and essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies and adversaries. Enemy organizations operate on physical battlegrounds and in other contested spaces such as perception, criminality, and political subversion. To consolidate gains, Army forces often play a supporting role by reinforcing and integrating the efforts of multiple partners. For example, Army units provide military support to governance, rule of law, and law enforcement. Expanded leader and Soldier competencies allow Army forces to consolidate gains in complex environments. Examples include support to law enforcement and financial actions for intelligence analysts, advanced situational awareness for combat arms, investigative skills for military police, reconstruction skills for engineers, rule of law advising for staff judge advocates, and institutional development for civil affairs officers and leaders within the institutional Army. Conventional and special operations forces work together to understand, influence, or compel human behaviors and perceptions. Army commanders understand cognitive, informational, social, cultural, political, and physical influences affecting human behavior and the mission. Leaders exert influence on key individuals, organizations, and institutions through cooperative and persuasive means. For example, when mission accomplishment requires strengthening partner institutions, Army forces exert influence to convince those partners that undertaking necessary reforms and strengthening critical institutions are in their interest. Emphasis on early and effective consolidation activities as a fundamental part of campaign design enables success and achieves lasting favorable outcomes in the shortest time span."</p>

Leaders must give best military advice and understand how to integrate military efforts with all elements of national power as well as the efforts of multinational partners.  Consider the following AOC description of how the Army gives the President, the Secretary of Defense and Combatant commanders multiple options for "projecting national power."</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>"Responding to crises, addressing the drivers of conflict, and achieving sustainable political outcomes require the application of all elements of national power (diplomatic, information, military, economic, financial, intelligence, and law enforcement). Army forces provide foundational capabilities to integrate the efforts of multiple partners. For example, Army headquarters provide joint, interorganizational, and multinational teams with the ability to plan, execute, and assess operations in complex environments. Army forces support partners with situational understanding, security, and logistics. Army forces ensure combatant commanders possess the ability to scale-up and sustain land forces rapidly through forward positioning, theater infrastructure capabilities, and the use of prepositioned equipment and supplies. Army headquarters and forces help impose order in chaotic situations and synchronize plans, programs, and efforts necessary to accomplish the mission. The Army is the only element of the Joint Force with the capability to integrate national power and the capacity to conduct sustained, campaign-quality land operations."</p>

			How big and how ready does the United States need the U.S. Army to be to meet its commitments? There is an imbalance between these commitments and America's current force planning. Correcting this would be challenging, but there are options that may help limit regret and strategic failures down the road.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>The Army Operating Concept (AOC) describes how Army forces operating as part of joint, interorganizational, and multinational teams accomplish the mission and win in a complex world.  As the nation's principal land force, the U.S. Army organizes, trains, and equips forces for prompt and sustained combat.  Army forces are prepared to do more than fight and defeat enemies; they must possess the capability to translate military objectives into enduring political outcomes.  Army forces must have the capability (ability to achieve a desired effect under specific standards and conditions) and capacity (capability with sufficient scale and endurance) to accomplish assigned missions while confronting increasingly dangerous threats in complex operational environments.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>This week’s professional reading considers the requirement for capacity in the Army.  The RAND report “Limiting Regret – Building the Army We Will Need,” by Timothy M. Bonds, Michael Johnson, and Paul S. Steinberg addresses how the U.S. Army, as part of a joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational force, can help the nation achieve its highest level national security interests and mitigate the most important risks.  The report concludes that there is mounting risk associated with an Army that is too small to protect the Nation and its interests abroad, and to uphold the U.S. international obligations around the world.    </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>Of course, in our democracy, we get the Army that the American public is willing to pay for.  It is our job to take the resources we receive and do our best in the CSA's three priority areas of readiness, developing the future force, and taking care of Soldiers and families.  Army leaders, however, must be able to describe the need for Army forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and for ample duration to, along with our joint partners, secure our nation.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>The attached report points out that threats to U.S. vital interests have increased since the publication of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.  To determine what forces the Army will need the authors ask “what does the nation require from the Army to meet these challenges and how does this national need translate to sufficient end strength to avoid strategic failure and regret?”  The report examines five key issues:  </p>

Force 2025 Maneuvers are those physical (experimental, evaluations, exercises, modeling, simulations and wargames) and intellectual (studies analysis, concept, and capabilities development) activities that help leaders integrate future capabilities and develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges.  Using the AWFCs as the analytical framework, the Army conducts Force 2025 Maneuvers to develop concepts, operational and organizational plans, DOTMLPF solutions, leader and Soldier assessment tools, and policy solutions to achieve the vision of the future force.  Learning and analysis under Force 2025 Maneuvers also inform Total Army Analysis and force management decisions related to the composition (organizations) and mix (active, Army National Guard, and U.S Army Reserve) of the operational force.  This RAND report is helpful to our efforts to mitigate risk associated with reductions in Army capacity.</p>

		<title>The Use of Indigenous Forces in Stability Operations (page 69)</title>

		<description>

			The U.S. military experience in the Philippines following the Spanish–American War has attracted a significant amount of historical attention in recent years as an example of a successful

			counterinsurgency effort. Accounts of American attempts to pacify the Philippines typically concentrate, however, on the role of the regular Army during the years immediately following the end of the war, particularly the period from 1899 to 1902. This focus on the role of conventional military forces in the immediate aftermath of the war has overshadowed the role played by less traditional organizations, particularly indigenous security forces such as the Philippines Constabulary, in the conduct of long-term stability operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>The historian Sir Michael Howard observed that we should not study history to make us “clever for the next time,” but instead to help make us “wise forever.”  The study of history helps military leaders ask the right questions and understand the complex causality of events in war.  Our Army's history makes clear that the need to consolidate military gains politically in Iraq and Afghanistan was not unusual.  In 1901, Secretary of War Elihu Root commented on “the wide range of responsibilities which we have seen devolving upon officers charged with the civil government of occupied territory; the delicate relations which constantly arise between military and civil authority.”  To ensure that the Army was prepared for the complexity of war, Root emphasized the “manifest necessity that the soldier, above all others, should be familiar with history.”</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>This week’s professional reading, Robert Angevine's “The Use of Indigenous Forces in Stability Operations,” describes the challenges our Army faced at the turn of the 20th Century.  Those challenges are familiar to anyone who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Angevine's study of counterinsurgency, wide area security, and stability operations in the Philippines from 1901 to 1917 reveals the enduring importance of developing adaptive leaders, resilient Soldiers, and cohesive teams to thrive in uncertain and dangerous environments.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The Philippines is a vast island chain that contains tremendous ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity.  At the turn of the twentieth century, local elites exercised almost absolute authority because of the lack of a central government.  With the conclusion of the Philippine War and the capture of Edwin Aguinaldo in 1901, the United States faced two major challenges: organizing the governance for secure portions of the Philippines and defeating the remaining pockets of resistance.  The first step was to establish an effective civil government which involved a transfer of all executive powers from the United States military to the central government.  U.S. Army officers were instrumental in the development of civil government at the local level by organizing municipal governments and temporarily serving as provincial governors and revenue collectors.  As America began to drawdown troop strength, the developing Philippine government required a force capable of ensuring law and order and conducting limited irregular warfare to provide security and stability, consolidate gains, and to create conditions for sustainable political outcomes.  The solution was to create a Constabulary as the armed police force of the government with the purpose of maintaining law and order, preventing and detecting crime.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>Initially consisting of Filipino enlisted men led by American NCOs and officers, the Constabulary was also charged with preventing and suppressing brigandage, unlawful assemblies, riots, and insurrections.  However, their unofficial functions were much broader.  The Constabulary opened trails and roads, mapped vast uncharted areas, built bridges, market places, schools, docks, churches, and worked closely with health and agriculture officials to eradicate disease and improve the food quality.  They also inspected the local police forces of every municipality, set up telephone and telegraph infrastructure, provided medical assistance to local residents, and headed disaster relief efforts.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p> Angevine identifies two factors that contributed to the Constabulary’s ability to consolidate gains, extend government control into remote areas of the islands, and gain acceptance of the Filipino populations.   First, members of the Constabulary understood the cultural, social, and political geography of the Philippines and were able to negotiate that terrain effectively.  To do this American leaders learned local laws, customs, and dialects and selected indigenous enlisted men to serve in their native provinces, emphasizing selection of those who had close connections to the local elites.   Second, the constabulary forces were well trained and performed a variety of civil-military tasks.  Reconnaissance patrols (continuous reconnaissance as a fundamental of security operations) allowed close interaction with the population to “keep in touch with the people and prevent entry of or formation of ladrone bands.”   To summarize, the Philippine Constabulary’s success in achieving a sustainable political outcome was due to their ability to work with partners to provide security and governance, and deliver a broad range of public services.  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The Army Operating Concept recognizes that effective stability and wide area security operations result from Army commanders who understand cognitive, informational, social, cultural, political, and physical influences affecting human behavior and the mission.  Leaders exert influence on key individuals, organizations, and institutions through cooperative and persuasive means. For example, when mission accomplishment requires strengthening partner institutions, Army forces exert influence to convince partners that reform and strengthening critical institutions are in their interest.  Emphasis on early and effective consolidation activities as a fundamental part of campaign design enables success and achieves lasting favorable outcomes in the shortest time span.  Consider how we might apply these lessons to the following Army Warfighting Challenges:</p>

			Political scientists, historians, and military strategists have long sought to determine how interactions of power, politics, and warfare affect the achievement of national security objectives. National security leaders should periodically examine these questions because resources, capabilities, and corresponding goals change over time. Today, the increasingly sophisticated use of hybrid and unconventional approaches to warfare by America’s enemies are again challenging the orthodox understanding of the line between war and peace.

U.S. defense strategy requires ready land forces (Army, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Forces) capable of operating as part of joint teams in sufficient scale and for ample duration to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and create multiple options for responding to and resolving crises. As the nation’s principal land force, the U.S. Army organizes, trains, and equips forces for prompt and sustained combat.  Army forces are necessary to defeat enemy organizations, control terrain, secure populations, consolidate gains, and preserve joint force freedom of movement and action.  Forward positioned and regionally engaged Army forces build partner capability, assure allies, and deter adversaries.  </p>

Consistent with the Army Operating Concept, Sutton and Lohaus argue there are four important factors that make the joint force an effective instrument of power.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </li>

It is for that reason that forward deployed forces support the nation’s international policies more directly and effectively than an equivalent force at home.  Forward-deployed, actively engaged forces in key locations enhance situational awareness, anticipate demands, assure partners, deter adversaries, and prevent conflict in times of peace.</li>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <li>It is difficult to replicate the level and quality of political commitment inherent in the forward deployment of American ground forces.  We need a paradigm shift from thinking of the military as an instrument of last resort to recognizing and embracing the capabilities that the joint force brings to all levels of the escalatory spectrum.  </li>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <li>Demonstrating US commitment, establishing relationships with regional military and political leaders, and improving the capability of hosts to handle their own security challenges are just a few of the benefits of persistent and enduring engagement. Another is a better appreciation of operational and strategic context.</li>

Humans constitute the defining characteristic of the environment. It is important for armed forces to establish contextual understanding well before conflicts begin.  Evolving operational demands require a force that can evaluate and understand the social, cultural, physical, informational, and psychological elements influencing actors in the environment. Increased understanding of the human factors that influence the operational environment decreases the chances of strategic surprise or that an aggressor will miscalculate US resolve or capability.</li>

			This spring, the Rangers, Pakistan’s paramilitary security force, launched a series of raids into Karachi’s slums for what was described by the government as a crime-prevention campaign. Members of the force blocked off the streets surrounding the city’s poorest neighborhoods and exchanged fire with the locals. Over several days, the Rangers seized several caches of weapons and captured or killed dozens of alleged gang members.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>The Army Operating Concept observes that the percentage of the world’s population in urban areas will rise to sixty percent by 2030.  As cities grow, many governments fail to provide adequate security, employment, infrastructure, and services.  Armed groups are able to exploit popular disaffection and weak governance.  These weakly governed, dense urban areas can become safe havens and support bases for terrorists, insurgents, and criminal organizations.  As advanced weapons become more readily available to these organizations (what some have called the 'democratization of destruction'), dense and weakly governed urban areas could become 'launching pads' for terrorist attacks that include long range missiles and potentially weapons of mass destruction.  This long range threat from urban areas is analogous to the shorter range threat to Israel emanating out of the Gaza strip. Future Army forces must be prepared to operate in urban areas.  This week's professional reading helps us better understand the geographic, political, social, and military dynamics within a particularly complex dense mega-cities.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>“Gangs of Karachi” by Matthieu Aikins, describes complex interactions between criminal and political organizations in Karachi, a mega-city of approximately 20 million people.  Aikins focuses on the rise and fall of Uzair Baloch.  Uzair, a member of Pakistan’s Baloch ethnic group, was both a political representative of his district and a gang leader targeted by Pakistan’s paramilitary security force.  Aikins describes Uzair’s 'Godfather II' moment as he attempts to transform himself from a gangster into a legitimate politician through a series of power struggles.  He is eventually exiled for failing to meet the demands of his criminal organization and the needs of Karachi’s wealthier citizens for security.  The story of Uzair illustrates the complex conditions within dense and weakened urban environments that contain licit and illicit power structures.  For Army leaders to thrive in these uncertain and chaotic conditions they must be able to understand the cognitive, informational, social, cultural, political, and physical influences that affect human behavior.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>Today, terrorist and insurgent organizations across the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia are using violence and tactics similar to those encountered in Uzair’s Karachi neighborhood.  These groups use sophisticated propaganda campaigns to excite historical grievances among ethic or sectarian groups and pit communities against each other.   Insurgent, terrorist, and criminal organizations portray themselves as patrons or protectors of parties to these conflicts and gain control of territory, economies, and populations.  They use that control to generate revenue, mobilize additional resources and extend their power base.  It is clear from Aikins' article and global trends that future Army conventional and special forces will have to develop situational understanding alongside indigenous partners and in close contact with civilian populations.  In particular, developing an understanding of the special circumstances and recent experiences of the people among whom wars are fought is essential if military forces are to avoid mistakes, consolidate gains, and isolate enemies from popular support.  And future forces will have to integrate the efforts of multiple joint, interorganizational, and multinational partners.

The following AWFCs are relevant to Aikins' essay.</p>

		<title>Experimental Units: The Historical Record</title>
		<authors>
			<author>Dr. Williamson Murray</author>

		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>

			In the past Experimental units have played a major role in extending combat capabilities

			and developing new concepts and doctrine for military organizations confronting

			seemingly insoluble challenges. Consequently, experimental units have become an essential

			part of the processes of successful and often revolutionary transformation and innovation.

			This paper focuses on experimental units in the first half of the twentieth century: the

			experimental units of the First World War (German Stormtroopers and the British tank

			corps) and the experimental units in the interwar years (the German panzer force, the

			British Experimental Tank Force, and the US Navy’s carrier experiments). All faced the

			same types of problems, and any success in the field was based, in part, on their leaders’

			ability to challenge the traditions and culture of their services.

Murray emphasizes the importance of experimental units in developing new capabilities and innovating in peacetime and wartime.  The essay builds on ideas contained in previous weekly reading #49 (25 Jul 15) in which Dr. Murray identified the following four attributes of successful military innovation:

AWAs are Force 2025 Maneuvers capstone learning events.   Over the next month, BMC, in partnership with FORSCOM, I Corps, 1st Armored Division, ASA (ALT), ATEC, Joint partners (USAF, USN, USMC, the Joint Staff), and international partners will conduct the inaugural AWA, a Joint and multinational exercise to develop and refine concepts and capabilities.  Although the AWA includes prototypes and surrogates for new capabilities, emphasis is on rigorous assessments of new concepts and the development of DOTMLPF interim solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges.  The AWA and all events under Force 2025 Maneuvers (our Army's campaign of learning) focus on bridging ideas and concepts into integrated actions that improve the future force.</p>

			More than a year after declaring the Caliphate the Islamic State has control over large swaths of territory in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, where millions of people live under its ironclad rule. As the group has dominated headlines around the world with scenes of its unmatched brutality and military exploits, it has acquired a reputation as a bloodthirsty gang surviving and thriving off of its savagery alone.

		<description>

			Much of the future-looking discussion in national security circles today focuses on autonomous systems and cyber weapons. Largely missing from this discussion is a place for humans on the battlefield. Do today’s emerging and potentially disruptive technologies mean that humans

			will no longer be important in future warfare? A look at historical military operations and current technologies suggests the proper response is that, to paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of man’s obsolescence have been exaggerated.

<!--HEADER-->
<p>Team,</p>
<p>The application of emerging technology creates the potential for affordable, interoperable, autonomous, and semi-autonomous systems that improve the effectiveness of Soldiers and units.  Andrew Herr argues in this week's reading, "Will Humans Matter in the Wars of 2030?", that future robotic technologies and autonomous systems will augment Soldiers and increase unit capabilities, situational awareness, mobility, and speed of action.  Herr summarizes the capabilities as well as the limitations of robotic and autonomy enabled systems.  He concludes that the "confluence of technical, tactical, operational , strategic, and ethical reasons strongly suggest humans will play crucial roles in all aspects of warfare over the next two decades - and probably longer."   He cautions that, based on enemy countermeasures, operating in a technology-denied environment may be the critical skillset needed in future wars. 

</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>As we continue to work with joint partners, industry, and key stakeholders in developing future force capabilities, Herr's ideas are important and reinforce many of our technological first principles in the AOC:  

</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>(1) Emphasize integration of technology with Soldiers and teams.</p>
    <p>(2) Simplify systems and integrate Soldier training into design.</p>
    <p>(3) Maximize reliability and reduce life cycle costs.</p>
    <p>(4) Design redundant systems that improve effectiveness under conditions of uncertainty.</p>
    <p>(5) Develop systems that degrade gracefully.</p>
    <p>(6) Maintain foundational knowledge to reduce the opportunity for surprise.</p>
    <p>(7) Reduce logistical demands.</p>
    <p>(8) Anticipate enemy countermeasures.</p>
    <p>(9) Ensure interoperability.</p>
    <p>(10) Consider scale and organizational implications. </p>
    <p>ARCIC is developing an Army Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) strategy.  It will be published in December.  The strategy will focus on the integration of RAS into our formations to provide leaders and units with the necessary situational awareness and understanding, mobility, lethality, stand-off from threats, weapons platforms, and flexible sustainment capabilities.  The RAS Strategy will drive modernization by evaluating trends, fostering innovation, and enforcing prioritization within
        <br/> the near-, mid-, and far-term while simultaneously ensuring that future Army forces are able to:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>See and fight across extended distances</li>
            <li>Share situational awareness and promote operational understanding across all echelons</li>
            <li>Operate widely dispersed while maintaining mutual support</li>
            <li>Gain and maintain contact with the enemy to set favorable battlefield conditions</li>
            <li>Sustain high tempo operations at the end of extended and contested lines of communication</li>
            <li>Establish and maintain security across wide areas -pose enemy forces with multiple dilemmas while reducing risk to Soldiers and units.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Herr's article is consistent the robotics strategy as well as our emphasis in the AOC on achieving overmatch "through powerful combinations of leadership, skilled Soldiers, and technology" and our focus on fitting machines to Soldiers rather than the other way around.  We will refine the draft RAS Strategy based, in part, on what we learn about the integration of multiple systems with Soldiers and units during the Army Warfighting Assessment this October at Fort Bliss, Texas. </p>
    <p>As we develop the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Strategy we invite your ideas.  Please contact Mr. Chris Stolz at christopher.p.stolz.civ@mail.mil </p>
    <p>Please continue to provide your ideas, experiences, analysis, and lessons learned within the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges.</p>

			Russia’s and China’s new focus on “limited war” capabilities is challenging America’s traditional methods of deterrence by punishment. To deal with this problem, the United States needs to strengthen its frontline allies’ ability to deter by denial.

This week’s professional reading, “The Case for Deterrence by Denial” by A. Wess Mitchell further emphasizes the importance of conventional land forces in deterring conflict and provides further support to the conclusions reached by Michael Gerson in our weekly reading #51. 

 </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>Mitchell states that the evolving threat environment is posing significant challenges to traditional extended deterrence based on punishment. The challenges surface because of the sheer number of competitors that the United States must deter, that America’s rivals are becoming better armed, the limitations of advanced technology, and America’s rivals continue to develop tactics for evading retaliatory deterrence.   </p>

			You may fly over a land forever; you may bomb it, atomize it, pulverize it and wipe it clean of life—but if you desire to defend it, to protect it, and keep it for civilization, you must do this on the ground, the way the Roman legions did, by putting your young men into the mud. — T.R. Fehrenbach

<p>Team, </p><p> The Army Operating Concept (AOC) emphasizes that American military power is joint power.  Since World War II the prosperity and security of the United States have depended, in large measure, on the synergistic effects of capable land, air, and maritime forces. They have reinforced one another in the conduct of joint operations and together provided options that any one or two services could not provide alone. Since World War II deterring great power conflict entailed approximately 400 million man-years of troop deployment.  Today, the need for forces stationed forward or rotating forward is increasing as Russia employs "new generation warfare" directed against what Russian leadership perceives as NATO weaknesses.  </p><p>This week’s professional reading emphasizes Joint force interdependencies in deterring conflict and winning wars.  In “Precision Firepower: Smart Bombs, Dumb Strategy,” then - LTC Timothy Reese argues that there is "no single-dimensional military solution to winning the peace...The debate over whether air forces, navies, or armies are most decisive in war is an argument that obscures the strategic question: how do we achieve policy objectives with military means?" Reese concludes that the artful combination of air and naval firepower with landpower provide the best ways and means to achieve the ends (sustainable political outcomes) in war.  His conclusion is consistent with the AOC:  balanced Joint Force capabilities create synergy and provide the President, Secretary of Defense, and combatant commanders with multiple options to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars.</p><p>The AOC observes that diverse enemies will employ traditional, unconventional, and hybrid strategies to threaten U.S. security and vital interests.  Threats may emanate from nation states or nonstate actors such as transnational terrorists, insurgents, and criminal organizations.  Enemies will continue to apply advanced as well as simple and dual-use technologies (such as improvised explosive devices).  Enemies avoid U.S. strengths (such as long-range surveillance and precision strike) through traditional countermeasures (such as dispersion, concealment, and intermingling with civilian populations).  As new military technologies are more easily transferred, potential threats emulate U.S. military capabilities to counter U.S. power projection and limit U.S. freedom of action.  These capabilities include precision-guided rockets, artillery, mortars, and missiles that target traditional U.S. strengths in the air and maritime domains.  Hostile nation states may attempt to overwhelm defense systems and impose a high cost on the United States to intervene in a contingency or crisis.  State and nonstate actors apply technology to disrupt U.S. advantages in communications, long-range precision fires, and surveillance.  Enemy actions reduce U.S. ability to achieve dominance in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.   Our ability to deter adversaries and defeat enemy organizations will continue to depend on the imaginative employment of joint capabilities, including land forces capable of conducting expeditionary maneuver and joint combined arms operations.</p><p>Colonel (ret.) Tim Reese's essay is important because it encourages a discussion about implicit, flawed assumptions about future warfare that could result in unaccounted risk in national defense due to an imbalanced joint force. <b> These include:</b></p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>complex political-military problems can be solved from standoff range.</li><li> deterrence results from the threat of punitive action such as the delivery of "overwhelming firepower" rather than regionally aligned, forward positioned and rotational joint forces able to assure partners and deter adversaries through denial.</li><li>warfare entails sanitary “power projection” rather than fighting across all domains in uncertain and chaotic environments.</li><li>technology can substitute for capacity, especially capacity in ready joint forces.</li><li> joint forces can be formed ad hoc (i.e. aggregate and disaggregate) without training together to develop a common understanding of how to fight together as a team.</li></ul><p>Please continue to provide your ideas, experiences, analysis, and lessons learned within the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges.</p>

		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>

			The article discusses the principle of deterrence in terms of using conventional weapons rather than nuclear weapons. It is noted that this was a major topic of interest for national security strategists during the cold war, and is likely to become a significant issue again in the early 21st century. The distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial is addressed and their role in U.S. military policy is analyzed.

<p>Team, </p><p>Army forces possess unique capabilities that allow the commander in chief, secretary of defense, and combatant commanders to reassure partners and deter aggression.  The Army Operating Concept highlights the Army's role, as part of the Joint Force, in communicating U.S. commitment, assuring allies, dissuading adversaries, and deterring conflict.  </p><p>This week’s professional reading emphasizes the importance of conventional land forces in deterring conflict.  Michael Gerson in argues that conventional military forces are essential to deterrence because they deny an adversary the best chance of success on the battlefield - a surprise or short-notice attack with little or no engagement with American military forces.  The absence of credible conventional forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and ample duration to win could lead adversaries to conclude that they can execute low-cost operations that rapidly achieve limited objectives.   He concludes that US conventional land forces positioned forward are critical to deterring adversaries from waging limited war for limited objectives.   </p><p>His conclusion that "By deploying robust conventional forces in and around the theater of potential conflict, the United States can credibly signal that it can respond to conventional aggression at the outset,"  is consistent with Barry Blechman's and Stephen Kaplan's excellent essay in the 1978 book “Force without War: U.S. Armed Forces as a Political Instrument.” (Brookings).  Blechman and Kaplan argue that forward deterrence is important because, “the fact that military personnel (and often their dependents) are located in an area of potential conflict means that the state making the deployment can ill afford to shut its eyes to potential threats in the region. Hence the location of forces abroad can sometimes support a nation’s policies more directly and effectively than a force of equal capability which is kept at home, even when provisions are made to move the latter force quickly and effectively when needed.”   </p><p>The Army Operating Concept observes that “Army forces have long been essential to preventing conflict through the forward positioning or rotation of forces overseas... While long-range strike and offshore capabilities will remain important to joint force operations, deterring threats from extended distance through retaliation often proves insufficient because determined adversaries attempt to achieve objectives rapidly at low cost prior to a U.S. or allied response.  Army forces communicate U.S. commitment.  Army forces and their partners bolster forward defense to dissuade adversaries who are unwilling to risk direct confrontation.  Moreover, Army forces are critical to deterring conflict because they are capable of compelling outcomes without the cooperation with the enemy."</p><p>See Reading #42 in which Jakub Grygiel and Wes Mitchell consider Russia's 'hybrid war' invasion of eastern Ukraine and the threat to the Baltic States.  They observe that defense in depth does not work in limited war and instead propose "preclusive defense -- the defense of a frontier that contests territory from the opening round." They argue that forward basing in the Baltic States, Poland and Romania would "enhance NATO's credibility and capability to deter any military attempt to revise the existing political order."  <a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/LPD/professional-readings-archive.aspx?pageNo=2" target="blank">http://www.arcic.army.mil/LPD/professional-readings-archive.aspx?pageNo=2</a></p><p>To read more from the Army Operating Concept, please go to:  <a href="http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/TP525-3-1.pdf" target="blank">http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/TP525-3-1.pdf </a></p>

			The U.S. military faces an era of enormous complexity. This complexity has been extended by globalization, the proliferation of advanced technology, violent transnational extremists, and resurgent powers. America's vaunted military might stand atop all others but is tested in many ways. Trying to understand the possible perturbations the future poses to our interests is a daunting challenge. But, as usual, a familiarity with history is our best aid to interpretation. In particular, that great and timeless illuminator of conflict, chance, and human nature--Thucydides--is as relevant and revealing as ever. In his classic history, Thucydides detailed the savage 27-year conflict between Sparta and Athens. Sparta was the overwhelming land power of its day, and its hoplites were drilled to perfection. The Athenians, led by Pericles, were the supreme maritime power, supported by a walled capital, a fleet of powerful triremes, and tributary allies. The Spartan leader, Archidamius, warned his kinsmen about Athens' relative power, but the Spartans and their supporters would not heed their king. In 431 BCE, the Spartans marched through Attica and ravaged the Athenian country estates and surrounding farms. They encamped and awaited the Athenian heralds and army for what they hoped would be a decisive battle and a short war. The scarlet-clad Spartans learned the first lesson of military history--the enemy gets a vote. The Athenians elected to remain behind their walls and fight a protracted campaign that played to their strengths and worked against their enemies. Thucydides' ponderous tome on the carnage of the Peloponnesian War is an extended history of the operational adaptation of each side as they strove to gain a sustainable advantage over their enemy..

	<p>Team, </p><p>

    The Army Operating Concept states:  Future armed conflict will be complex, in part, because threats, enemies, and adversaries are becoming increasingly capable and elusive. State and nonstate actors employ traditional, unconventional, and hybrid strategies that threaten U.S. security and vital interests. The complexity of future armed conflict is due to increasing momentum of human interaction, threats emanating from dense and weakly governed urban areas, the availability of lethal weapon systems, and the proliferation of CBRNE threats. Enemies and adversaries will challenge U.S. competitive advantages in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains. Advanced technologies will transfer readily to state and nonstate actors. Enemies possess the capability to threaten the U.S. homeland and project power from land into all other domains. Because these threats may originate in dense urban areas or remote safe havens, long-range strikes will prove insufficient to defeat them. The complexity of future armed conflict, therefore, will require Army forces capable of conducting missions in the homeland or in foreign lands including defense support of civil authorities, international disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, security cooperation activities, crisis response, or large-scale operations. What all Army operations will have in common is a need for innovative and adaptive leaders and cohesive teams that thrive in conditions of complexity and uncertainty.

</p><p>

    With this in mind, the professional reading for this week is “Hybrid Warfare and Challenges” by Frank G. Hoffman, published in the 1st Quarter 2009 issue of Joint Forces Quarterly.  The article is attached and can also be accessed at http://smallwarsjournal.com/documents/jfqhoffman.pdf.  In the article, Dr. Hoffman describes the problem of future armed conflict and identifies implications for the operational and organizational concepts of future Army forces.

</p><p>

    Dr. Hoffman argues that, in the future:  Traditional conflict will still pose the most dangerous form of human conflict, especially in scale. With increasing probability, however, we will face adversaries who blur and blend the different methods or modes of warfare. The most distinctive change in the character of modern war is the blurred or blended nature of combat. We do not face a widening number of distinct challenges but their convergence into hybrid wars.  These hybrid wars blend the lethality of state conflict with the fanatical and protracted fervor of irregular warfare. In such conflicts, future adversaries (states, state-sponsored groups, or self-funded actors) will exploit access to modern military capabilities, including encrypted command systems, man-portable air-to-surface missiles, and other modern lethal systems, as well as promote protracted insurgencies that employ ambushes, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and coercive assassinations. This could include states blending high-tech capabilities such as antisatellite weapons with terrorism and cyber warfare directed against financial targets.

</p><div>

    Hoffman concludes, "The rise of hybrid warfare does not represent the end of traditional or conventional warfare.  But it does present a complicating factor for defense planning in the 21st century."  To this, he offers several important implications for the future force:

    <ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>preserve all required skills and competencies to execute Joint Combined Arms Maneuver</li><li>develop cognitive skills needed to recognize or quickly adapt to the unknown</li><li>adapt campaign planning to simultaneously execute conventional warfare and counter-insurgency</li><li>develop small unit leaders with decision-making skills and tactical cunning to respond to the unknown</li><li>improve organizational learning and adaptation</li><li>invest in diverse educational experiences</li><li>invest in force protection: counter-UAS, IED-defeat, counter-rocket/mortar/missile</li></ul></div><p>Ensuring that future Army forces are prepared to win in a complex world requires a focused, sustained, and collaborative effort across the institutional Army, the operating force, the joint community, industry, academia, and other interorganizational and multinational partners.  Within Force 2025 and Beyond, the Army's comprehensive effort for changing the Army and improving landpower capabilities, the Army Warfighting Challenges offer the analytical framework to integrate efforts across warfighting functions.  </p><p>

        Dr. Hoffman provides a compelling counter to arguments that the Army should focus on one form of conflict.  We cannot entertain the conceit that we will get to pick our enemies.

    </p><p>

        Your innovative thinking is critical to improving our Army.  Please continue to provide your ideas, experiences, analysis, and lessons learned within the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges:

		<description>

			The period between the two World Wars has special relevance to DOD’s joint experimentation efforts. During the interwar period, U.S. and foreign military innovations provided long term and successful transformations of military capabilities. This paper provides a look at these experimentation efforts, highlights the attributes of success, and offers lessons for current and future DOD joint experimentation tasks over the next decade. Elements of innovation were identified, i.e., establishing a framework intellectual creativity over the long haul, testing concepts to the breaking point, and learning from the past (the culture of experimentation).

<p>Team, </p><p>This week's reading is “Experimentation in the Period Between the Two World Wars: Lessons for the Twenty-First Century”, by Dr. Williamson Murray.  This paper was published by the Institute for Defense Analyses on 30 November, 2000. </p><p>Dr. Murray's identifies attributes of successful experimentation and lessons for current and future experimentation.  He argues that the following elements contributed most to successful innovation during the interwar period:   </p><p><ul><li>-Emphasis on creative rather than on evaluative measures of effectiveness.</li><li>- Experimentation as part of a sustained campaign rather than a single event. </li><li>- Tolerance for surprise as well as failure.</li><li>- Red teaming to test fully concepts and emerging capabilities.</li><li>- Learning from past military experience through careful and thorough analysis.</li><li>- Willingness to use and protect forward thinkers throughout experimentation and innovation.</li></ul></p><p>Dr. Murray observes that military organizations that possessed the majority of these attributes innovated successfully and "where they did not, experimentation floundered or resulted in fundamentally flawed innovations." </p><p>The elements of innovation apply to Force 2025 and Beyond, our Army’s comprehensive effort to innovate and ensure that our forces are able to win in a complex world.  Key to Force 2025 and Beyond is Force 2025 Maneuvers: The Army's Campaign of Learning.  Force 2025 Maneuvers encompass the intellectual (studies, analysis, concept, capabilities development) and physical (experimentation, evaluations, exercises, modeling, simulations, wargames) activities that help leaders integrate future capabilities and develop interim solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs).  Using the AWFCs as the analytical framework, the Army conducts Force 2025 Maneuvers to develop concepts, operational and organizational plans, DOTMLPF interim solutions, leader and Soldier assessment tools, and policy changes to improve the combat effectiveness of the future force. </p><p>Dr. Murray's paper is particularly relevant as we develop future operational and organizational plans as the foundation for designing future organizations.  In mid-August a Force 2025 Maneuvers planning conference will refine objectives for the FY16 Maneuvers/Campaign of Learning.  Using F2025 Design Principles, F2025 Maneuvers will include a series of seminars and war games to define force echelons and capabilities, design organizations, and describe how those organizations will operate together in a Joint Operations Area to accomplish the mission in future armed conflict.  Exercises and the Army Warfighting Assessment at Fort Bliss will help refine force design and determine priorities based on the combination of capabilities that most improve the combat effectiveness of Army forces.  Dr. Murray's elements of successful innovation will serve as evaluation criteria for our efforts.   </p><p>As identified above, one of Dr. Murray's key elements to successful military innovation is a "consistent emphasis on learning from the past and the present."  The AOC emphasizes that "continuous feedback, collaboration, and teamwork are keys to the success of Force 2025 and Beyond."  Changes to organizational design will draw on interim solutions to AWFCs.

			To win within all operational frameworks, BCTs must understand the operational

			environment, shape the operational environment through action, engage local leaders

			to influence the population, and consolidate gains to seize, retain, and exploit initiative.

			Commanders shape the operational environment by conducting multiple missions and

			efforts seeking to achieve a common goal and end state that nests with high command

			objectives and end state. Commanders must have an understanding of competing

			interests within the operational and information environment to determine what is of

			value to competitive parties and entities within their area of operations. Understanding

			interests helps develop courses of action to engage leaders and information operations

			the populace and political structure, enhance the security situation, and lead to mission

			success. BCTs consolidate gains and favorable milestones to seize and exploit

			weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and further the interests of allies to secure

			stable political settlements and objectives complimentary to desired outcomes.

<p>Team, </p><p>This week's reading is Chapter 3, Shape, Engage, and Consolidate Gains, from 

the new Reconnaissance and Security Operations field manual, FM 3-98, 

published 1  JUL 2015.  The manual in its entirety can be downloaded at 

http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/fm3_98.pdf

 </p><p>It was the result of developing doctrine in a different way.  The Maneuver Center of Excellence 

cancelled the doctrine writing contract and asked Forces Command units and Combat Training Centers to identify members of the writing team.   They worked remotely and then came 

together for a writing conference.  This is a manual that draws on the 

experiences and ideas of our junior leaders and field grade officers.  Their 

work influenced the Army Operating Concept.

 </p><p>This chapter emphasizes the importance of shaping operational environments 

through action and engagement during all phases to gain situational awareness 

and understanding, influence and reassure key partners and actors, and to 

identify opportunities to seize, retain, and exploit initiative.

 </p><p>Shaping operations require an understanding of the operational environment. 

Increased situational understanding enhanced through habitual relationships 

and engagement activities (regionally aligned forces, sustained Army Special 

Forces engagement, and Army National Guard partnerships) help promote security 

conditions consistent with U.S. national security interests.  And, to 

accomplish the mission, Army forces must exert influence on friendly, neutral, 

and adversarial actors through cooperative, persuasive, or coercive means. 

These are the main points.

 </p><p>While the ideas in the chapter are sound, we need to sharpen our language and 

clarify how Army forces shape security environments, exert influence on key 

actor in those environments, and consolidate military gains to achieve 

sustainable outcomes.  We need your contributions.  Please contribute to the 

Army Warfighting Challenges.

			This article assesses how we think about future war,

			drawing attention to its associated caveats, obstacles, and intellectual

			problems. It is divided into three sections: the first acknowledges

			that predicting the future is immensely problematic, but suggests

			history can be a critical guide. The second assesses the present and

			why it is difficult to conceive of accelerating change. The third examines

			the trends of future war. The article concludes with implications

			for US forces.

			<![CDATA[

<p>Team,</p><p>This week's professional reading is "Predicting Future War" by Dr. Robert A. 

Johnson.  The article was published in Parameters Spring 2014 edition, pages 

65-76. 

</p><p>In his essay, Dr. Johnson discusses how to think about future war, examines 

trends in armed conflict, and identifies implications for U.S. forces.  He 

states that "the true value of history is not to invoke direct analogies, nor 

does the answer lie in trying to extract selections to suit a particular 

agenda, as so often occurs. The value of history is rather in encouraging 

critical reflection, to ask questions, and to challenge the positivist 

assumptions that crowd our field of view. We are subject to the flux of 

history, and we cannot entirely escape our present, but we should seek to 

break free of unreasoned supposition about the future through critical 

thinking."

</p><p>Dr. Johnson identifies a number of widely held implicit assumptions about 

future war and warns against projecting patterns of recent conflicts 

uncritically onto future ones.  While trends may be identified, the broad 

acceptance of these implicit assumptions make the future appear easier and 

fundamentally different from the past.  If not challenged, these assumptions 

could result in an ill prepared or unbalanced Joint Force.  Assumptions that 

make future war appear easy also generate a tendency to undervalue ready land 

forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and for ample duration to 

accomplish the mission in future war.

</p><p>In his conclusion, Dr. Johnson examines trends in future war and potential 

implications for armed forces.  His essay is consistent with the Army 

Operating Concept which states that future armed conflict will be complex, in 

part, because threats, enemies, and adversaries are becoming increasingly 

capable and elusive. State and non-state actors will employ traditional, 

unconventional, and hybrid strategies to threaten U.S. security and vital 

interests. The complexity of future armed conflict is due to increasing 

momentum of human interaction, threats emanating from dense and weakly 

governed urban areas, the availability of lethal weapon systems, and the 

proliferation of CBRNE threats. Enemies and adversaries will challenge U.S. 

competitive advantages in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace 

domains. Advanced technologies will transfer readily to state and non-state 

actors. Enemies possess the capability to threaten the U.S. homeland and 

project power from land into all other domains. Because these threats may 

originate in dense urban areas or remote safe havens, long-range strikes will 

prove insufficient to defeat them. The complexity of future armed conflict, 

therefore, will require Army forces capable of conducting missions in the 

homeland or in foreign lands including defense support of civil authorities, 

international disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, security 

cooperation activities, crisis response, or large-scale operations.

</p><p>Understanding trends and their implications for our Army and Joint Force is 

important in designing the future force.  Our Army is developing design 

principles to guide future force development.  As you read Dr. Johnson's 

essay, please consider the following DRAFT Design Principles for Future Force 

Development.  Please provide criticisms and suggestions concerning the Design 

Principles to Colonel Eric Land at  eric.a.land2.mil@mail.mil

</p><h3>Force 2025 Design Principles:</h3><p><ol><li>Future formations must demonstrate increased combat effectiveness when 

measured against their ability to satisfy the Army Warfighting Challenges, the 

Army core competencies (Shape the Security Environment, Set the Theater, 

Project National Power, Combined Arms Maneuver, Wide Area Security, Cyberspace 

Operations, Special Operations) and tenets (Initiative, Simultaneity, Depth, 

Adaptability, Endurance, Lethality, Mobility, Innovation) as outlined in the 

Army Operating Concept (http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/TP525-3-1.pdf )

</li><li>Design organizations to conduct decentralized combined arms, air-ground 

operations across wide areas.

</li><li>Design organizations to task organize rapidly and integrate the efforts of 

multiple partners (joint, interorganizational, and multinational).

</li><li>Design organizations to deploy rapidly and transition quickly to operations 

of sufficient scale and ample duration to accomplish the mission.

</li><li>Design organizations with the appropriate combination of mobility, 

protection and firepower to overmatch the enemy in close combat, operate 

dispersed while maintaining mutual support, and concentrate rapidly to strike 

the enemy from unexpected directions and seize upon fleeting opportunities.

</li><li>Design organizations to secure wide areas and protect populations to 

consolidate gains and achieve sustainable outcomes.

</li><li>Design organizations to conduct continuous reconnaissance and security 

operations to preserve joint force freedom of action, create and preserve 

options, and develop situational understanding in close contact with 

populations and elusive enemies.

</li><li>Design organizations to ensure uninterrupted mission command and integrate 

the efforts of joint, interorganizational, and multinational partners across 

wide areas with tailorable command posts and access to reach despite enemy 

efforts to disrupt communications.

</li><li>Design organizations that maximize the strengths and compensate for the 

weaknesses of each Component to ensure maximum total Army combat effectiveness 

and capacity.

</li><li>Design organizations to employ dynamic combinations of conventional and 

unconventional forces, to provide the necessary SOF and conventional 

competencies, to assist partners with internal defense as well as the 

capabilities to understand, influence, or compel human behaviors and 

perceptions.


</li><li>Design organizations to ensure freedom of movement and action during high 

tempo operations at the end of extended and contested lines of communications 

in austere environments.

</li><li>Design organizations for manned and unmanned teaming to see and fight 

across wide areas, reduce tactical risk, magnify capabilities, and post the 

enemy with multiple dilemmas.

</li><li>Design organizations to ensure synergy between operational and generating 

forces in training and education as well as during contingency operations.

</li><li>Design organizations to maintain overmatch through combinations of 

leadership, skilled soldiers, and technology, and maintain a decisive edge in 

the human dimension with resilient Soldiers, adaptive leaders, and cohesive 

teams.

</li><li>Design organizations to gain asymmetric advantages and protect the force 

from emerging disruptive technologies.

</li></ol></p><p>


In addition to hearing your thoughts and ideas on the draft design principles, 

please continue to provide your ideas, experiences, analysis, and lessons 

learned within the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges.</p>

			We meet today some eight months after the September 4, 2014 NATO summit in Wales, United Kingdom. That meeting of Allied heads of state proved to be an important inflection point for the Alliance. When planning for that summit began, its primary objective was to mark the end of NATO’s combat operations in Afghanistan. Some were even concerned about the future relevance of NATO, anticipating that it was about to enter a period of unprecedented operational inactivity following decades of defending against the Soviet Union, managing conflict in the Balkans, and, more recently, contributing to out‐of area undertakings in Afghanistan and even Iraq.

			Instead, the Alliance’s agenda that Fall was dominated by events that most policy‐makers on both sides of the Atlantic failed to anticipate. These, of course, include Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sudden and bloodthirsty rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq. A read of the summit communiqué reflects other challenges confronting the Alliance: missile proliferation, chaos in Libya, crises in Mali and the Congo African Republic, threats to the global commons – including its cyber and maritime domains, and Iran’s nuclear program, among others.

<p>Sticking with the theme of the importance of ready land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale to deter and prevent conflict, the professional reading for this week is the prepared testimony of Ian Brzezinski, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Policy, to the Senate Committee on the Armed Services on 28 April 2015.  

Mr. Brzezinski argues that Russia's aggression against Ukraine presents a significant challenge to the security and stability of Europe.  He notes Russian Army modernization efforts and significant improvements in the quality and capabilities of the forces between the 2008 invasion of Georgia and the invasion of Crimea.  He notes Russia's use of conventional forces and a sophisticated propaganda campaign to intimidate neighbors, sow dissent among allies, and probe the resolve of the West.  Foundational to Russian efforts are military exercises that sometimes involve more than 150,000 personnel, a scale that dwarfs NATO exercises (see attached chart).  

The Army Operating Concept recognizes Russia as a competing power and draws attention the importance of land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and ample duration to deter aggression.  The AOC observes that "Army forces engage regionally to ensure interoperability, build relationships based on common interests, enhance situational awareness, assure partners, and deter adversaries.  Because threats starting at low levels often gain strength and become more dangerous over time, Army forces engaged regionally are essential to the defense policy goals of shaping security environments and preventing conflict...  When needed, Army forces reinforce or bolster the efforts of partners... Conventional and special operations forces contribute to a global land network of relationships resulting in early warning, indigenous solutions, and informed campaigns.  Regional engagement sets favorable conditions for a commitment of forces if diplomacy fails."

		<description>PRAGUE -- When the crisis in Ukraine dramatically heated up last November and in the ensuing weeks, I was impressed by the ability of the Russian state to mobilize so many different tools in its bid to destabilize its neighbor. It became clear very quickly that Russian politicians, journalists, purportedly nongovernmental organizations, state companies, think tanks, the military, the courts, government agencies and the Duma were all working from the same instructions for the same goals. At the time I remarked on Twitter that the crisis showed the tactical effectiveness of the "unitary state" Russian President Vladimir Putin has been building since 1999. In June, I came across a fairly obscure article by General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of the Russian Federation, and was struck by how closely it mirrored my observations of the unfolding Ukraine crisis.</description>

			<![CDATA[

<p>The Army Operating Concept observes that "anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict."  Gerasimov emphasizes continuity in war's political nature as well as how technology is changing the character of armed conflict.    Russian actions in Ukraine are consistent with Gerasimov's article and reveal potential enemy capabilities for which our Army must be prepared.   We will learn from the experience in Ukraine as we develop the future force.  Please get involved and help us develop interim solutions to the Warfighting Challenges.</p>

		<description>The business world has a term to describe core missions to customers and investors—value proposition—and it is considered crucial to every company’s business strategy. If you can’t distill what makes your organization valuable down to a few compelling points, then maybe it doesn’t have a good reason for existing. Or, maybe you’re in the wrong job. The notion of a value proposition has meaning for any military service trying to preserve its core capabilities in peacetime. That’s especially true in democracies, where political leaders don’t need to use force to stay in power. Unless military institutions can frame their message to democratic leaders in terms that have political salience during prolonged periods of peace, they risk being dismantled to a point where they invite derision, not to mention aggression.  The U.S. Army knows this story all too well. In the centennial year of 1876, a service that had enrolled a million men during the final year of the Civil War had shrunk to a mere 28,565 soldiers. Clearly, the Army’s leaders had not developed a convincing value proposition for maintaining robust land warfare capabilities. Something similar happened after World War I, when the Army collapsed from well over 2 million men in 1918 to less than 140,000, even as fascists began to make gains in Europe and the Far East.</description>

<p>Thompson recounts our nation's history of reducing the size of the Army after periods of war.  He argues that reducing the size of the Army beyond the point of acceptable risk may stem from a misunderstanding of the importance of land forces to American joint military power.  Army leaders understand that, in our democracy, we get the Army that the American people are willing to pay for and it is our job to provide the best force we can with the resources we are allocated.  However, Army leaders must also be prepared to provide best military advice on what is needed to maintain an effective balance of manpower, readiness, and modernization.  Our most senior leaders have done just that, but we must all be prepared to reinforce their explanation and engage in conversations on this topic with our civilian leaders and interested fellow citizens.  Thompson's essay is consistent with the Army Operating Concept -- leaders might reread chapters 2 and 3 to review the argument for ready land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and for ample duration to accomplish the mission in future armed conflict.  It is also excellent beach reading.</p><p>Reading Thompson's essay and the AOC may call into question implicit assumptions that result in an undervaluing of ready land forces capable of operating in sufficient scale and for ample duration to deter war and accomplish the mission in future armed conflict.   Because those assumptions are implicit, risk associated with them goes unaccounted and may be mounting based on recent events and developments that threaten US national and international security.  Based on the public discourse on defense it seems that the following are some of those assumptions:</p><ul class="body"><li class="body">That the Joint Force and inter organizational partners can solve complex political-military problems from standoff range.</li><li class="body">That a narrow range of military technologies are "decisive" in war.</li><li class="body">That technology can substitute for capacity (i.e. size), especially capacity in ready land forces.</li><li class="body">That partners will be reliable, possessing both the capability and will to act consistent with U.S. national interests.</li><li class="body">That consolidation of gains is not an inherent aspect of armed conflict.</li><li class="body">That ad hoc joint teams can 'aggregate' and 'disaggregate' without losing combat effectiveness.</li><li class="body">That a sanitary form of 'power projection,' rather than fighting under chaotic and uncertain conditions, is what the Joint Force does to respond to and resolves crises.</li><li class="body">That deterrence comes from stand-off capabilities or the application of overwhelming firepower rather than forward deterrence and the ability to deny an enemy even limited objectives.</li></ul><p>Thompson's eight unique values of Army forces align very closely with our Army Core Competencies of:  Shape the Security Environment, Set the Theater, Project National Power, Combined Arms Maneuver, Wide Area Security, Cyberspace operations, and Special Operations.</p>

		<description>First, as a small local war meant to readjust some limited, precise territorial claim, but nothing beyond. Such wars of territorial adjustment had little or no systemic effects. Limited wars understood in this way did not fundamentally alter or re-arrange the balance of power. They were limited both in geography and scope.  The other limited war occurs when there is an ongoing change in the balance of power. There is a level of uncertainty about the new balance of power, and the state initiating a limited war is not sure about its own position in the system. It doesn't want to start a large-scale systemic war because it may turn out to be too costly. A limited war is a good way to test how far it can go. In many ways, the first objective of a limited war is to avoid the big war while trying to gauge the resilience of the existing order. In this sense the significance of a limited war is different: it is a local war, but for larger regional or global purposes. If we can capture this in a bumper sticker it would be: act locally but think globally. It is to some extent what we see now happening in Ukraine: limited wars but with larger global repercussions.</description>

<p>Grygiel and Mitchell argue that "Russia sees a permissive environment in which violence can achieve much more and in a quicker way than any other tool."  The value of limited war is that "it deepens the cleavages between the frontline states" and "fuels accommodationist tendencies" in states that do not want to risk confrontation.</p><p>To counter Russia, they offer three recommendations:  build capacity and capability, modernize, and re-arrange the geographic disposition of bases and forces.  They argue that defense in depth does not work in limited war and instead propose "preclusive defense -- the defense of a frontier that contests territory from the opening round."  Forward basing in the Baltic States, Poland and Romania would "enhance NATO's credibility and capability to deter any military attempt to revise the existing political order."</p><p>The Army Operating Concept recognizes the deterrent value of land forces.  "Army forces have long been essential to preventing conflict through the forward positioning or rotation of forces overseas. Regionally engaged Army forces are needed to build partner capability, assure allies, and deter adversaries. While long-range strike and offshore capabilities will remain important to joint force operations, deterring threats from extended distance through retaliation often proves insufficient because determined adversaries attempt to achieve objectives rapidly at low cost prior to a U.S. or allied response. Army forces communicate U.S. commitment. Army forces and their partners bolster forward defense to dissuade adversaries who are unwilling to risk direct confrontation. Moreover, Army forces are critical to deterring conflict because they are capable of compelling outcomes without the cooperation of the enemy."</p>

		<title>American Landpower and the Two-war Construct</title>

			<author>Dr. Richard D. Hooker, Jr.</author>
		</authors>
		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>Since the end of the Cold War, both Democratic and Republican administrations have relaxed the traditional emphasis on maintaining an ability to fight and win two major conflicts simultaneously. Often derided as old thinking, the "two-war construct" actually remains as valid as ever for the world's only remaining superpower, as the National Defense Panel recently pointed out in its critique of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. With global responsibilities to secure a rules-based international system based on a worldwide integrated economy, the United States depends on a global network of alliances and partnerships involving more than 60 friendly states that collectively account for almost 80 percent of global gross domestic product and more than 80 percent of global military spending.  U.S. credibility therefore hinges on a demonstrated ability to fight and win in two wars at once, as failure to honor security commitments in one theater calls all others into question. As this paper spells out, American Landpower, through no fault of its own, is clearly not up to the task. As defense spending continues to drop, acquisition of high-priced air and naval systems continues unabated, while the U.S. Army is marginalized.</description>

<p>As stated in the Army Operating Concept, American military power is Joint power.  To succeed, the Joint Force needs ready land forces capable of operating in sufficient capacity and ample duration to accomplish the mission.  Land forces remain essential for shaping security environments, deterring conflict, defeating enemy organizations, security territory, protecting populations, and consolidating gains.  Dr. Hooker highlights the need to connect force structure to defense strategy through a realistic consideration of future threats as well as recent experience.</p>

		<description>Natural Resources Counterinsurgency Cell (NRCC): In retrospect, the NRCC found that the tactics it used within its area of operations (AO) in eastern Afghanistan (an area comprised of the four provinces of Nuristan, Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman; hereafter referred to collectively as N2KL) required approaches that resembled the tribal engagement Strategy employed by Pershing and Bliss in the Philippines one hundred years prior.</description>

<p>The article highlights the importance of consolidating gains as an integral part of armed conflict and essential to retaining the initiative over determined enemies.  To consolidate gains, Army forces often play a supporting role by reinforcing and integrating the efforts of multiple partners.  For example, Army units must be prepared to provide military support to governance, rule of law, and law enforcement. Expanded leader and Soldier competencies will allow future Army forces to consolidate gains in complex environments.  These competencies include support to law enforcement and financial actions for intelligence analysts, advanced situational awareness for combat arms, tactical questioning for scouts, investigative skills for military police, reconstruction skills for engineers, rule of law advising for staff judge advocates, and institutional development for civil affairs officers and leaders within the institutional Army.</p>

		<title>Bridging the Planning Gap:  Incorporating Cyberspace into Operational Planning</title>
		<authors>
			<author>Colonel Martha S. H. VanDriel</author>
		</authors>
		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>Cyberspace operations have a far-reaching, permanent impact on military operations. At the conceptual level, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) now recognizes five warfighting domains: land, maritime, air, space, and cyber. While there are examples of how cyberspace support to military operations have advanced over the past decade, one gap has not been addressed in detail—operational planning.   It is clear that in U.S. military operations, the land, maritime, air, and space domains rely heavily on cyberspace. Therefore, cyberspace operations must be viewed in the context of all domains and be included as part of the overall operational scheme of maneuver. For if a commander postures his or her command to fight an adversary in the first four domains but ignores cyberspace, not only will that commander have ceded the cyberspace domain to the adversary, but the adversary can then proceed to undermine that commander’s effectiveness in the other four domains.</description>

<p>The AOC recognizes that enemies and adversaries will challenge U.S. competitive advantages in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains.  In future armed conflict, a broad array of actors will use cyberspace to challenge the Joint Force's freedom of action from the strategic to the tactical level.  The cyberspace and space domains as well as the electromagnetic spectrum are growing in importance as state and non-state actors develop capabilities to protect their access and disrupt or deny access to others.</p><p>Commanders and staffs must integrate cyberspace, space, and electronic warfare considerations into tactical and operational estimates and plans.  This week's professional reading is "Bridging the Planning Gap:  Incorporating Cyberspace into Operational Planning" by Colonel Martha S.H.

		<description>Through oil smuggling, kidnapping, human trafficking and extortion, ISIL is one the best funded militant groups the United States has confronted. Avoiding a protracted conflict with ISIS requires a more integrated financial and military strategy to undermine the group’s territorial control and reach.</description>

			<![CDATA[

<p>In this essay, Paul Kan describes the role of organized crime in ISIL's rise and how ISIL uses criminal activities to maintain and expand territory.  Criminal activities fund weapons, training, and recruiting and has allowed ISIL to access resources independent of state sponsorship.</p><p>Kan argues that "due to the significant role that crime plays in ISIL's power, the United States will require a more integrated financial and military strategy to undermine the group's territorial control and reach." He observes that "airstrikes and proxy forces can do little to reduce ISIL's criminal activities... An air force is not a police force... There are some clear limits to what the United States and coalition can achieve without seizing and holding ISIL territory."   Kan recommends that the international community consider the strategy employed in Colombia where the government "implemented a coordinated approach to tackle the various militant groups, including the FARC, that were challenging the Colombian state by expanding the presence of the state to deny sanctuary to militant groups; protect the population once under the control of militant groups; and to directly target the illegal drug trade which financed the militant groups and contributed to the growth of corruption and crime."</p><p>Kan's essay amplifies a number of important themes in the Army Operating Concept:</p><ul class="body"><li class="body">Compelling sustainable outcomes requires land forces to defeat enemy organizations, establish security, and consolidate gains.</li><li class="body">Army forces develop situational understanding through action.  As part of joint teams, Army forces see, fight, learn, and adapt operations while maintaining contact with the enemy across land, air, maritime, space and cyberspace domains.  Increasingly, this will require the integration of military intelligence and criminal intelligence.  Our intelligence analysts must be able to develop products to meet the threshold for a broad range of actions beyond military operations such as investigations and prosecutions; targeted economic sanctions; freezing of financial assets; travel bans; and visa denials.</li><li class="body">Army forces conduct security operations across wide areas to ensure freedom of movement and action and deny the enemy the ability to disrupt operations.  Increasingly this will require the integration of military operations and law enforcement efforts.  As stated in the AOC, "Army forces integrate with partner military, law enforcement, and civil capabilities to establish and maintain security."</li><li class="body">The Army's ability to integrate the efforts of partners is essential to shaping security environments and consolidating gains.</li></ul><p>Professor Kan's essay is particularly relevant to the following Warfighting Challenges:</p>

		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>"Superiority" is a science fiction short story by Arthur C. Clarke, first published in 1951.  It depicts an arms race, and shows how the side which is more technologically advanced can be defeated, despite its apparent superiority, because of its own organizational flaws and its willingness to discard old technology without having fully perfected the new. Meanwhile, the enemy steadily built up a far larger arsenal of weapons that while more primitive were also more reliable. The story was at one point required reading for an industrial design course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</description>

			<![CDATA[

<p>This week's professional reading has been used by me before – (see Ben Fitzgerald's excellent commentary on that previous post, Readings 18A & 18B).  "Superiority" by Arthur C. Clarke, originally published in 'The Magazine for Fantasy and Science' in August 1951.  Our thanks to Principal Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Hon. Karl Schneider, for recommending that we send it out again.  It seems particularly prescient as Russia masses conventional forces on the Ukraine border and prepares for the display of its range of new combat vehicles and weapon systems in the May Day parade on 9 May.</p><p>Science fiction can help us think about future war.  In this essay, Clarke employs an un-named leader of a nation's armed forces to recount the sequence of events that led to defeat in war.  The leader testifies that "the ultimate cause of our failure was a simple one:  ... we were defeated by one thing only - by the inferior science of our enemies."   The losing nation possessed superior military technology.  Its defense strategy, however, was based on a belief that technology had brought about a "revolution in warfare."  The nation reduced fighting capacity and readiness while overinvesting in unsuitable, unproven, and immature technologies.</p><p>The Army Operating Concept states "anticipating the demands of future armed conflict requires an understanding of continuities in the nature of war as well as an appreciation for changes in the character of armed conflict.  Technological advances and changes in strategic guidance, joint operating concepts, and security challenges require the U.S. Army to innovate to ensure that forces are prepared to accomplish future missions...But recent and ongoing conflicts reinforce the need to balance the technological focus of Army modernization with a recognition of the limits of technology and an emphasis on the human, cultural, and political continuities of armed conflict."</p><p>In future force development, our Army pursues overmatch: the application of capabilities or use of tactics in a way that renders an adversary unable to respond effectively.  The Army achieves overmatch through powerful combinations of leadership, skilled Soldiers, and technology. While the development of and application of advanced technologies is important to maintaining our advantage over current and future enemies, the integration of a broad range of technologies into well trained and well led units is what we must emphasize in future force development.</p>

		<description>ONE OF THE GREAT understudied aspects of military history concerns the institutional cultures through which officer corps come to grips with the dynamic and ambiguous problems of war and peace. That institutional culture shapes the understanding of the strategic, operational, and tactical choices before the professional soldier, and it implants as well broader assumptions concerning the historical framework in which those choices find their meaning. It is a process that proceeds by means of formal education, informal acculturation, and practical experience.</description>

<p>Written nearly twenty years ago, Professor Murray stresses the importance of professional military education in helping us think clearly about future armed conflict.  He warned of the "danger in the belief that technology will offer us total battle-space and foreign policy dominance."  His article is appears relevant today as thinking associated with the RMA of the 1990s, thinking discredited by actual armed conflicts of the last fourteen years, is enjoying a resurgence and broad acceptance.  Theories of future war based in the belief that technological superiority in mainly standoff capabilities will solve the problem of future national security and substitute for a lack of capacity in ready land forces are making a comeback.  And those theories have gained broad acceptance even as practice and real experience points in a different direction.</p><p>Professor Murray offers a number of key points:</p><ul class="body"><li class="body">Military professionals must ask the right questions and make realistic assumptions.</li><li class="body">Although technology can offer substantial advantage against future opponents, the three most important elements in virtually all past revolutions in military affairs were not technological in nature.  They were conceptual, doctrinal, and intellectual.</li><li class="body">We must be careful not to overestimate the effects of technological superiority and underestimate the ability of our opponents to short-circuit or circumvent our advantages.</li></ul><p>He concludes:  "What we will need in the next century is a deeper understanding of the political context of war and the very different set of assumptions that our opponents may bring to it.  We will require knowledge of foreign languages, cultures, religious beliefs, and above all history... What matters most in war is what is in the mind of one's adversary, from command post to battlefield point-of-contact."</p><p>The Army Operating Concept is consistent with Professor Murray's writings.  Appendix C of the AOC is particularly relevant as it highlights:  The Army recognizes that there are no "silver bullet" technological solutions.  The Army retains overmatch through combining technologies and integrating them into changes in organizations, doctrine, leader development, training, and personnel policies. The Army's ability to achieve significant leaps in warfighting efficiency and effectiveness requires an understanding of the interaction of technology with changes in doctrine, organizations, training, and other elements of combat effectiveness.</p>

		<title>Robotics on the Battlefield Part II: The Coming Swarm</title>

			<author>Paul Scharre</author>
		</authors>
		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>The unfolding robotics revolution is transforming a range of industries, from manufacturing to transportation, warehouse management, household appliances, toys, elder care and more. Similarly, it will lead to significant and perhaps surprising changes in warfare. Uninhabited vehicles, like the Predator aircraft or the Packbot ground robot, have already proven invaluable in today's conflicts. As uninhabited vehicles incorporate increasing automation and become true robotic systems, they will have tremendous value in future military operations. Individually, they will allow military forces to extend their reach into the battlespace, operating with greater range and persistence than would be possible with human-inhabited systems.</description>
		<commentTitle>Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster Comments:</commentTitle>
		<comment>
			<![CDATA[

<p>Scharre argues that "Emerging robotic technologies will allow tomorrow's forces to fight as a swarm, with greater mass, coordination, intelligence and speed than today's networked forces. Low-cost uninhabited systems can be built in large numbers, "flooding the zone" and overwhelming enemy defenses by their sheer numbers. Networked, cooperative autonomous systems will be capable of true swarming - cooperative behavior among distributed elements that gives rise to a coherent, intelligent whole. And automation will enable greater speed in warfare, with humans struggling to keep pace with the faster reaction times of machines."</p><p>The Army Operating Concept recognizes that "Science and technology helps shape the character of warfare" and states "the application of emerging technology creates the potential for affordable, interoperable, autonomous, and semi-autonomous systems that improve the effectiveness of Soldiers and units.  Autonomy-enabled systems will deploy as force multipliers at all echelons from the squad to the brigade combat teams."</p>

		</authors>
		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>Wargaming has a long history as an important tool for military training, education, and research. 1. In its broader application to nonmilitary conflict situations (see, for example, the recent books Wargaming for Leaders and Business War Games), the technique is increasing in popularity, particularly among businesses seeking strategic advantages. 2. (As a result, we will sometimes use the terms "wargaming" and "gaming" interchangeably; in the latter case, however, we mean what is called "serious gaming," not the more general sense, like gambling.) 3. Despite that history and popularity, however, wargaming's record of success is uneven. Some games seem to succeed very well in preparing important decision makers for real-world environments in which they later find themselves.  A prime example is the U.S. Navy's series of games during the 1920s and 1930s.</description>

<p>This week's professional reading is "Why Wargaming Works" by Peter P. Perla and ED McGrady, published in Naval War College Review, Summer 2011.</p><p>Force 2025 Maneuvers are critical to our learning.  Force 2025 Maneuvers are the physical (experimentation, evaluations, exercises, modeling, simulations, and wargames) and intellectual (studies, analysis, concept, and capabilities development) activities that help leaders integrate future capabilities and develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges.  Of these, wargaming, when integrated with analysis, exercises, and real-world experience plays a critical learning role.</p><p>Perna and McGrady emphasize the importance of wargaming for preparing leaders to make important decisions in future, real world environments.  Wargames allow leaders to gain wisdom of potential futures through interactive experience by igniting and using imagination to expand the realm of possibilities needed to shed light on that which is currently unpredictable, unknown, and unknowable.  Wargames also allow for failure and the ability to explore, reflect, and move beyond our own experiences.</p><p>Perna and McGrady argue that wargames derive their power from their nature as a constructive narrative.  To make better games, they challenge, we need to tell better stories to help address the complex and uncertain issues we will face today and in the future.</p><p>This discussion on the importance of narratives for wargaming is timely as we review Defense Planning Scenarios and other narratives.  Poor scenarios will lead to capacity and capability resource decisions that will leave the Army unprepared for future conflict.  Every effort should be made to ensure we challenge and correct both weak scenarios and the way they are combined to make future force decisions.</p>

		<description>It rained on Monday morning Sept. 15 over all Louisiana. From low, darkening clouds the drops spattered on the State's good highways, on its hundreds of marshy mud roads, on its pine forests, and on its deep swamps full of quicksand. The rain fell, too, on 350,000 U.S. soldiers and 50,000 U.S. Army vehicles as they fought the greatest sham battle in U.S. history. The attack had come before dawn. With two fast-moving, hard-hitting armored divisions leading the way, Lieutenant General Ben Lear, commander of the Second (Red) Army, had pushed his troops across the muddy Red River, was already sending long tentacles down the highways to the south, where Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Third (Blue) Army lay in wait. Overhead, armadas of pursuit planes fought great dogfights, while sleek A-20A attack bombers and Navy dive bombers strafed the columns of tanks and trucks moving up to the front.</description>

<p>In 1940, the Louisiana Maneuvers helped prepare the Army for combat operations in Europe.  However, as Mark Perry describes in this essay, the Maneuvers were more than a training exercise.  They also helped Army leaders develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges -- interim solutions that improved the combat effectiveness of the force.</p><p>Like the Louisiana Maneuvers, Force 2025 Maneuvers (our Army's campaign of learning) allows our Army to learn and apply what we learn to future force development.</p>

		<description>The tank has achieved a well-deserved aura of decisiveness and versatility in the annals of World War II history.  Images of German panzers dashing across Poland and France; of Rommel's tanks dominating the vast, open spaces of the North African desert; and of American tanks tearing across Western Europe tend to be what one sees when visualizing armor in World War II.  A common factor in the aforementioned theaters of war was terrain.  All were ideal tank country. All were ideal for vast maneuvers, flanking movements and large-scale armor-vs.-armor engagements.</description>

<p>Team,</p><p>Dr. Young describes the contributions of land forces in the Pacific theater of war during World War II and provides important considerations for future force development.  He argues that the Joint Force failed to achieve any appreciable gains in the early stages of the New Guinea campaign.  Enemy forces in well prepared defensive positions were able to secure key terrain and deny allied forces the ability to achieve operational objectives.  After several weeks of fighting, the introduction of combat vehicles provided land forces the appropriate combination of mobility, lethality, and protection to defeat enemy prepared positions, destroy enemy armored vehicles, close with and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver, and ensure freedom of maneuver and action in close contact with the enemy.  The success of combined arms maneuver allowed the joint force to seize, retain and exploit the initiative in the New Guinea campaign.</p><p>When considering future force development, the AOC describes the necessity to consider threats, enemies, and adversaries; missions; technology; and history and lessons learned.  Dr. Young highlights from a historical perspective capabilities that remain critical for expeditionary maneuver and joint combined arms operations as described in the Army Operating Concept.  Our combat vehicle modernization strategy calls for mobile protected firepower to ensure freedom of movement and action for light infantry forces in close contact with the enemy in restrictive and urban terrain.  Roughly seventy years later the Infantry Brigade Combat Team faces similar challenges.  Our Army is also developing a light reconnaissance vehicle to enable reconnaissance and security operations critical to protecting the movement of infantry during mounted or dismounted approach marches.  Both vehicles will also provide critical capabilities during forcible or early entry operations.</p><p>Army Warfighting Challenge (AWFC) 15, Conduct Combined Arms Maneuver, considers the requirements for mobile protected firepower in IBCTs, relates to this article.  You will notice that Dr. Young's essay provides insight into Learning Demands of the AWFC as well.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>H.R. McMaster</p>

<p>Team,</p><p>This week's professional reading is The Shadow Commander by Dexter Filkins, published in the New Yorker on 30 Sep 2013.</p><p>Since this article was published, Qassem Suleimani has come out of the shadows and is leading the Shia militia offensive against ISIL in Tikrit.  Written to introduce the general public to Suleimani, Mr. Filkins' article is particularly relevant to the Warfighting Challenge of how to develop and sustain a high degree of situational understanding when operating in complex environments and against adaptive enemies.  Leaders have to understand factors that are influencing the growing conflict across the greater Middle East and how those factors influence our mission.  Filkins argues that Iran fears its neighbors and has spent the greater part of three decades building a Shiite sphere of influence across the region.  Events since Filkins wrote the article are consistent with his argument.  Filkins identifies lessons that Iran gleaned from the Iran-Iraq War including:

</p><ul class="body"><li class="body">"Iran was surrounded by enemies, near and far" and </li><li class="body">The "futility of fighting a head-to-head confrontation."</li></ul><p>These lessons convinced Iranian leaders that they "had to build capacity to wage asymmetrical warfare - attacking stronger powers indirectly, outside of Iran."  By tracing the actions of Qassem Suleimani, Filkins shows how Iran has coordinated combinations of economic, diplomatic, and military elements of national power to advance national interests.</p><p>Iran develops partnerships with disenfranchised populations, religious factions, and criminal elements to create disorder focused on subverting the influence of the U.S. and partner nations.  Iran also develops relationships with weak governments and uses those governments to advance its interests.  For example, Iran's support for President Bashar al Assad in Syria is critical to its ability to sustain Lebanese Hezbollah, and Iran's support for militias in Iraq undermines government legitimacy and intensifies sectarian conflict.  Iran avoids direct military confrontations while developing advanced capabilities and pursuing comprehensive military modernization.  Iran's modernization efforts include the use of automated systems on land, sea, and air; ballistic missiles; and the development of nuclear capability.  Iran is actively supporting militia in Iraq while confronting the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).  Taken collectively, Iranian activity has the potential to undermine U.S. regional goals as it continues to confront the U.S. indirectly on a number of fronts.  Iran's hybrid armed forces highlight the need for Army forces to remain effective against the fielded forces of nation states as well as networked guerilla and insurgent organizations.  Filkins' article helps provide a better understanding of not only Iranian interests and Behaviors, but also the need for Army leaders to understand complex threats and operational environments in the conduct of Joint Combined Arms Operations.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>H.R. McMaster</p>

		<description>Operation Protective Edge, as the campaign was codenamed, was Israel's third war against Hamas in outcome has been far from conclusive. While Hamas sustained heavy casualties, and its military capabilities were seriously degraded, it tenaciously fought against a superior enemy and managed to subject most of Israel's population to constant rocket and missile attacks for seven full weeks. With both sides claiming victory and Palestinian-Israeli relations on a downward spiral, a fourth Gaza war seems only a matter of time.</description>

<p>Team,</p><p>This week's professional reading is The 2014 Gaza War:  Rethinking Operation Protective Edge by Eitan Shamir.</p><p>Mr. Shamir argues that Operation Protective Edge was politically inconclusive and therefore Israel must prepare for the next fight with Hamas.  He summarizes policy, strategy and force development decisions made by Israel prior to the war and connects those decisions to problems Israel experienced during the conflict.  He identifies lessons that have implications for future force development.  Mr. Shamir's essay is very consistent with the U.S. Army Operating Concept.  A few examples are listed below:</p><ul class="body"><li class="body">Enemy forces will avoid the strengths of friendly forces, employ advanced and simple technologies, and expand operations into the homelands of friendly forces</li><li class="body">Air operations and stand-off capabilities are important, but insufficient to win; close combat is necessary against adaptable enemies</li><li class="body">Land forces are required to compel sustainable political outcomes</li><li class="body">Combat in dense urban environments requires joint and combined arms capabilities</li></ul><p>Shamir's essay is relevant to the following Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs):

		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>At no other time in our history has there been such widespread confusion about the size, role, costs and effectiveness of our Armed Forces. With so many conflicting pressures, it is little wonder that we tend to lose sight of some of the fundamentals of a realistic defense force, an understanding of which can help us to more intelligent decisions across the whole spectrum of defense requirements. During this period of active negotiations and a renewed search for a new international order, it is particularly appropriate to examine the basics of our military structure. We have to assure ourselves as a nation that the military posture of the U.S. really does provide the capability to support United States national policy in all situations against all reasonable threats. We need to be sure that our military program provides for forces and measures that provide a credible, integrated, and realistic deterrent to war and, if necessary, to wage war in such a manner as to achieve our national objectives.</description>

<p>Team,</p><p>This week's professional reading is an AUSA position paper from 1973 titled "Why do we need an Army".  The authors argue that the military posture of the United States must be sufficient to support US National Policy in all situations against all reasonable threats.  They also argue that land forces are essential to national defense for both their ability to deter war and, if necessary, wage war.</p><p>Written more than 40 years later, the Army Operating Concept reflects great similarities to this AUSA paper.  Like the AUSA paper, the AOC recognizes that American military power is joint power and that balanced Joint Force capabilities create synergy and provide the President, Secretary of Defense, and combatant commanders with multiple options to prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars.  However, also like the AUSA paper, the AOC makes clear:</p><ul class="body"><li class="body">War will remain a contest of wills fought by people who inhabit land.</li><li class="body">Threats to U.S. vital interests across the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains originate on land.</li><li class="body">The employment of land forces is essential to achieve political outcomes.</li><li class="body">The diversity of threats to U.S. security and vital interests will increase the need for Army forces to prevent conflict and shape security environments.</li><li class="body">Army forces communicate U.S. commitment.</li><li class="body">Army forces are critical to deterring conflict because they are capable of compelling outcomes without the cooperation of the enemy.</li><li class="body">In the complex future operating environment and while operating against hybrid enemies, Army forces will be essential for projecting national power through support for diplomatic, political, law enforcement, development, and other efforts.</li></ul><p>The AUSA paper concludes that "diplomacy and military strength are not competing approaches in our pursuit of peace - they are part and parcel of our common approach to achieve detente."  Here, the Army Operating Concept is wholly consistent.</p>

<p>Team,</p><p>This week's professional reading is again on the the cyber domain.  A recent 60 Minutes segment titled "DARPA: Nobody's safe on the Internet" highlights the expansion of the cyberspace domain and the potential implications for criminal activities and national security.</p><p>The 60 Minutes segment highlights the vulnerabilities in all things networked.  The AOC (page 12) recognizes this:  Army commanders must protect their own systems and disrupt the enemy's ability to operate.

		<title>States, Insurgents, and Wartime Political Orders</title>
		<authors>
			<author>Paul Staniland</author>
		</authors>
		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>Bargains, deals, and tacit understandings between states and insurgents are common in civil wars. This fascinating mix of conflict and cooperation shapes patterns of politics, governance, and violence. Building on recent findings about state formation, I offer a conceptual typology of political orders amidst civil war. Wartime political orders vary according to the distribution of territorial control and the level of cooperation between states and insurgents.  Orders range from collusion and shared sovereignty to spheres of influence and tacit coexistence to clashing monopolies and guerrilla disorder. Examples from contemporary South Asian conflicts illustrate these concepts, which are scalable and portable across contexts. Scholars need to think more creatively about the political-military arrangements that emerge and evolve during war. A key policy implication is that there are many ways of forging stability without creating a counterinsurgent Leviathan.</description>

			<![CDATA[

<p>Team,</p><p>Staniland argues that scholars of civil war assume that contending armed actors are locked in a "struggle for a monopoly of violence.  As a result, political science lacks a conceptual language to describe varying political orders in civil war, much less theorize their origin." He notes the importance of the political relationship between the contenders and offers that "scholars often overlook the diverse interactions between states and insurgents that construct political authority and control.  State and non-state actors have both cooperative and conflicting relationships that create dramatic variations in who rules - and how - in war." With this in mind, he writes that "civil conflicts are frequently characterized by bargains, deals, and norms that structure patterns of violence, from collusion to spheres of influence to guerrilla disorder."  He concludes that the accurate identification of the relationship between contenders offers the opportunity to achieve an acceptable future.  The essay acknowledges the enduring nature of war, especially war's human, cultural, and political dimensions.  Although written to inform policy decisions about the ways of forging stability, Staniland's essay is relevant to Army leader competencies identified in the Army Operating Concept.  Especially the Army Operating Concepts need for leaders to be able to develop situational understanding in close contact with enemies and civilian populations as well as leaders' ability to thrive in complex environments, integrate the efforts of multiple partners, and consolidate military gains to achieve sustainable outcomes.</p>

		<description>This article assesses the state of the art in military innovation research. It begins with a description of the field's four major schools of thought, summarizing their central tenets, key points of similarity and differentiation, and major empirical cases. It then addresses priorities for future research, observing that while much has been learned about innovation originating among senior officers and civilian policy-makers, far less is known about innovation originating in field formations. Recent empirical studies hint at the importance of such bottom-up innovation but little progress has been made in achieving a conceptual understanding of the phenomenon. Therein lies the next major challenge, and opportunity, for the field.</description>

<p>Team,</p><p>This week's reading is "The Future of Military Innovation Studies," by Adam Grissom.</p><p>Grissom identifies four schools of military innovation research:  civil-military relations, interservice politics, intraservice politics, and organizational culture.  Each attributes military innovation to certain factors.  The essay poses a challenge to Army leaders.  The author observes that "the four contemporary schools of military innovation, and virtually every major study on the subject, argue that military organizations are intrinsically inflexible, prone to stagnation, and fearful of change.  They are large bureaucracies and, according to Stephen Rosen, 'Almost everything we know in theory about large bureaucracies suggests not only that they are hard to change, but that they are designed not to change.'</p><p>He goes on, however, to give examples of how militaries have innovated effectively from the bottom up.  The suggestion for our Army is that we need to do both.  We have an opportunity to do so under Force 2025 and Beyond using our Army's Campaign of Learning and the Warfighting Challenges. See Annex B of the Army Operating Concept (AOC).</p><p>The tenet of innovation in the AOC is defined as "the result of critical and creative thinking and the conversion of new ideas into valued outcomes.  Innovation drives the development of new tools or methods that permit Army forces to anticipate future demands, stay ahead of determined enemies, and accomplish the mission."  The purpose of Army innovation is to deliver the maximum capability to our Army in the shortest time with available resources.</p><p>Force 2025 and Beyond is our Army's comprehensive effort to innovate and improve the Army land power capabilities for the Joint Force.  Innovation requires learning organizations.  Our Army learns using the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges -- first order enduring questions, the interim answers to which will improve current and future force combat effectiveness.</p><p>Learning events -- experimentation, war-games, the Army Warfighting Assessment, exercises, combat experience -- serve as the foundation for Force 2025 Maneuvers and provide opportunities for focused and sustained collaboration across our Army as well as with the Joint Force, multinational partners, industry, academia, and others.</p>

		<description>THE EARLY DAYS of the last war, when armaments of all kinds were in short supply, the British, I am told, made use of a venerable field piece that had come down to them from previous generations. The honorable past of this light artillery stretched back, in fact, to the Boer War. In the days of uncertainty after the fall of France. These guns, hitched to trucks, served as useful mobile units in the costal defense. But it was felt that the rapidity of fire could be increased. A time-motion expert was, therefore, called in to suggest ways to simplify the firing procedures. He watched one of the gun crews of five men at practice in the field for some time. Puzzled by certain aspects of the procedures, he took some slow-motion pictures of the soldiers performing the loading, aiming, and firing routines. When he ran these pictures over once or twice, he noticed something that appeared odd to him. A moment before the firing the members of the gun crew ceased all activity and came to attention for a three-second interval, extending throughout the discharge of the gun. He summoned an old colonel of artillery, showed him the pictures, and pointed out this strange behavior. What, he asked the colonel, did it mean? The colonel, too, was puzzled. He asked to see the pictures again. '"Ah." he said when the performance was over. "I have it, they are holding the horses."</description>

<p>Team,</p><p>This week's reading is Elting E. Morison's "A Case Study in Innovation", published in the April 1950 edition of Engineering and Science Monthly.  As previously stated, innovation is a tenet in the Army Operating Concept.  Innovation is the result of critical and creative thinking and the conversion of new ideas into valued outcomes.  Morison's article takes a close look at change, the human responses to it, the friction and tension innovation creates, and pitfalls to overcome.  Many of his thoughts relate directly to the seven key conditions highlighted GEN Donn Starry's "To Change and Army", our 1 January reading.  As you read the article, consider the following:</p><ul class="body"><li class="body">The need to understand the effect innovation will have on those who identify themselves with familiar habits, current processes, and their own organizations.

<li class="body">The struggle for acceptance of new ideas and ways of operating is continuous.

<li class="body">That innovation is more than a new invention.  It is often the combination of familiar things seen in a different light.   Doctrine, training, leader development, force design, and soldier skills are as important to innovation as the materiel technology.  Innovations will often drive change across the DOTMLPF, warfighting functions, and army formations.  Our Army Warfighting Challenges and Force 2025 Maneuvers will help us integrate across all.

<li class="body">Having the right idea at the right time requires a "prepared mind", a little luck, and a favorable environment (the intellectual climate) to "conspire to produce sudden change."

<li class="body">Even innovations supported by detailed analysis and statistical data need a champion to force revolutionary change.  The champion requires an entrepreneurial mind set.

<li class="body">"...that any group that exists for any purpose - the family, the factory, the educational institution - might begin by defining for itself its grand object, and see to it that that grand object is communicated to every member of the group.  Thus defined and communicated, it might serve as a unifying agent against disruptive local allegiances of the smaller elements that compose any group."

</ul><p>Please review GEN Starry's seven conditions as you reflect on Mr. Morison's work and consider how we can take advantage of their ideas for our community of practice and across our Army.</p><p>And thanks to the whole team for all you do to ensure that our future force is prepared to win in a complex world.</p>

		<description>Commanders must grasp the role of cyberspace in national security, but that is a challenge without a ready way to visualize it. There is hope insofar as we can use extant ideas and language to conceptualize and teach cyberspace operations. That transition is only possible by first developing an underpinning theory and "narrative," with the theory expressing the omnipresence of cyberspace and its interface with the government and civilian sectors. Additionally it must span the range from national security policy to minute technical details while inculcating the tensions caused by its own relentless evolution. The second necessity is overcoming rivalries and committing sufficient resources to continuously man, equip, and train the cyberspace force and integrate it with the other domains.</description>

	Team,

	This week's professional reading is recommended by Lieutenant General Ed Cardon: "The Joint Force Commander's Guide to Cyberspace Operations" by Major General Brett T. Williams, Director of Operations, J3, for U.S. Cyber Command.

	The Army Operating Concept recognizes the growing importance of the cyberspace domain as global and regional competitors and non-state actors invest in capabilities to protect their access and disrupt or deny access to others.  A broad array of actors challenge the Joint Force's freedom of action in cyberspace.

	Cyber space operations are critical to the Army's ability to support joint force freedom of movement, to project national power from and into multiple locations and contested spaces, and to project power across the air, maritime, space and cyberspace domains.  To prevent enemy overmatch, the Army must

	develop new capabilities while anticipating enemy efforts to emulate or disrupt those capabilities.  Major General Williams' article provides clear implications for required capabilities.

	In addition to Major General Williams' article, please view the FireEye Cyber Threat Map <A href="https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html" target="blank" class="std" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'LPD', 'Embed Link', 'https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html');">https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html <img src="../app_Imgs/link_newwin.png" alt="Opens a new tab or window" class="link"></a>.   This map shows a subset of real cyber-attack data and helps to emphasize the significance of the cyber threat.

		<description>Col. Gordon "Skip" Davis sat at the conference table in the dusty operations center in Afghanistan and paged through his notes. It was June 2008 and surrounding him were the over-caffeinated members of the combined joint planning team representing the Commander, International Security Assistance Forces (COMISAF). They were eager to meet and greet their inter-agency and inter-governmental partners in the effort and had worked hard to prepare for the engagement. While Col. Davis had already met the representatives from the United Nations (UN) and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), his team wanted to make a good impression by sharing their initial mission analysis. Col. Davis allowed them to brief with the caveat that the ISAF planners would seek input from the others.</description>

	Team,   This week's professional reading is the Small Wars Journal article "The Power of Discourse" by Angela Karrasch and Heather Gunther, published in May, 2014.  The Army Operating Concept (AOC) describes how future Army forces will prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars while operating as part of the Joint Force and working with multiple partners.  Army forces integrate the efforts of joint, coalition, and interorganizational partners to project national power.  This demands that Army leaders develop the skills required to build and lead highly diversified teams.  Karrasch and Gunther offer a number of techniques for discourse and decision making in diverse teams.  The techniques identified in this short essay are useful for military and civilian leaders across the Joint Force.

		<description>As every seasoned executive has learned, few policies remain valid for as long as 20 to 30 years. Nor do most assumptions about the economy, about business, about technology remain valid longer than that. Yet most of our assumptions about business, technology and organization are at least 50 years old. They have outlived their time. As a result, we are preaching, teaching and practicing policies that are increasingly at odds with reality and therefore counterproductive.</description>

	Team,

	This week's professional reading is Peter F. Drucker's article "Management's New Paradigms" from 1998. While focused on methods and roles of management, the author includes a number of important ideas about innovation and entrepreneurship. Drucker notes that "an organization that does not innovate, and does not engage in entrepreneurship will not survive long."  He argues that "every institution - and not only business - must build into its day-to-day Management four entrepreneurial activities that run in parallel...these disciplines are not just desirable. They are the conditions for survival today."

	- Abandon products, services, processes, markets, distribution channels and so on that are no longer an optimal allocation of resources.  (What should we divest?)

	- Organize for systematic, continuing improvement. (Force 2025 maneuver and our work under the Warfighting Challenges).

	- Organize for systematic and continuous exploitation, especially of its successes. Build a different tomorrow on a proven today. (Our Army as a learning organization; applying what we learn under Force 2025; see Annex B of the Army Operating Concept).

	- Organize systematic innovation; create the different tomorrow which makes obsolete, and to a large extent replaces, even the most successful products today.  (See innovation as a tenet and the discussion of technology in the Army Operating Concept.)

		<description>The Dynamics of Military Revolution bridges a major gap in the emerging literature on revolutions in military affairs. It suggests that two very different phenomena have been at work over the past centuries: "military revolutions," which are driven by vast social and political changes, and "revolutions in military affairs," which military institutions have directed, although usually with great difficulty and ambiguous results.  MacGregor Knox and Williamson Murray provide a conceptual framework and historical context for understanding the patterns of change, innovation, and adaptation that have marked war in the Western world since the fourteenth century--beginning with Edward III's revolution in medieval warfare, through the development of modern military institutions in seventeenth-century France, to the military impact of mass politics in the French Revolution, the cataclysmic military-industrial struggle of 1914-1918, and the German Blitzkrieg victories of 1940. Case studies and a conceptual overview offer an indispensible introduction to revolutionary military change,--which is as inevitable as it is difficult to predict.</description>

	Team,

	Innovation is a tenet in the Army Operating Concept.  Innovation is the result of critical and creative thinking and the conversion of new ideas into valued outcomes.

	This week we'll conduct our Innovation Symposium and identify opportunities to improve our Army's ability to innovate to deliver the maximum capability to the force in the shortest amount of time with the resources available.

	As we pursue innovation we might consider the observations that Dr. Williamson Murray and Dr. MacGregor Knox made in The Dynamics of Military Revolution, 1300-2050.  Attached is the conclusion, "The Future Behind Us."  Especially important to remember are their four points on the last three pages.

	Happy New Year!

		<title>To Change an Army</title>

			<author>General Donn A. Starry (US Army Retired)</author>
		</authors>
		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>(Document page #394, PDF File page #418) Reform of an institution as large as our Army is problematic under the best of circumstances. The recent history of change in military systems of the world is instructive. Let us examine the story of Sir Swinton's invention—the tank—as well as the history of the development of concepts for mobile all-arms warfare to illustrate the challenges that would-be reformers face in trying to introduce new ideas.</description>

	Team,


	Here is our first reading of 2015: "To Change an Army" by General Donn

	Starry.


	In 2015 the Army will innovate and develop future force capabilities under

	Force 2025 and Beyond. To change the Army and improve land power 123456

	capabilities for the Joint Force, General Starry identifies seven key

	conditions:


	- An institution or mechanism to identify the need for change, to draw up

	parameters for change, and to describe clearly what is to be done and how

	that differs from what has been done before. (we will do this under Force

	2025 Maneuvers and our work on the Warfighting Challenges).

	- The educational background of the principal staff and command

	personalities responsible for change must be sufficiently rigorous,

	demanding, and relevant to bring a common cultural bias to the solution of

	problems. (our study of military history is critical and we must foster and

	maintain an understanding of war and warfare and view problems through the

	lens of joint and combined arms capabilities).

	- There must be a spokesman for change. The spokesman can be a person, one

	of the mavericks; an institution such as a staff college; or a staff agency.

	(our leadership has been strong here and the CSA is driving change).

	- Whoever or whatever it may be, the spokesman must build a consensus that

	will give the new ideas, and the need to adopt them, a wider audience of

	converts and believers. (the collaborative nature of our learning efforts

	and applying what we learn through the Warfighting Challenge construct is

	critical as is the work we are doing together in refining the ideas in the

	Army Operating Concept through the functional concepts, the combat vehicle

	modernization strategy, and the network refinement effort as well as

	experimentation to refine those concepts and required capabilities).

	- There must be continuity among the architects of change so that

	consistency of effort is brought to bear on the process.  (our argument for

	change must be compelling and we must base our efforts on first principles

	-- see Annex B of the Army Operating Concept).

	- Someone at or near the top of the institution must be willing to hear out

	arguments for change, agree to the need, embrace the new operational

	concepts, and become at least a supporter, if not a champion, of the cause

	for change. (this condition is met today).

	- Changes proposed must be subjected to trials. Their relevance must be

	convincingly demonstrated to a wide audience by experiment and experience,

	and necessary modifications must be made as a result of such trial outcomes.

	(we need everyone's participation in Force 2025 Maneuvers to include

	wargaming, exercises, experimentation, operational experience, and the Army

	Warfighting Assessment).


	All best wishes for the New Year.  I am optimistic about the future of our

	force despite resource constraints because of the talented team we have

	working to ensure that our Army remains prepared to win in a complex world.

	Team, the Army Operating Concept states: "The tenet of innovation challenges us to anticipate changing conditions to ensure that Army forces are manned, trained, and equipped to overmatch enemies in order to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. We must not be consumed with focusing solely on avoiding risk, but build leaders and institutions that recognize and leverage opportunities. Leaders at all levels must encourage prudent risk taking and not allow bureaucratic processes to stifle them. Finally, we must assess our efforts continuously and be prepared to adapt to unexpected opportunities and unanticipated dangers. Our Army must continuously learn, adapt, and innovate." How do we create an open environment for innovation across our organizations and overcome bureaucratic and intellectual obstacles? How might we set conditions for innovation as we work together in a focused, sustained, and collaborative manner using the framework of the Army Warfighting Challenges. All the best, HRM

		<title>Superiority</title>
		<authors>
			<author>Arthur C. Clarke</author>
		</authors>
		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>"Superiority" is a science fiction short story by Arthur C. Clarke, first published in 1951. It depicts an arms race, and shows how the side which is more technologically advanced can be defeated, despite its apparent superiority, because of its own organizational flaws and its willingness to discard old technology without having fully perfected the new. Meanwhile, the enemy steadily built up a far larger arsenal of weapons that while more primitive were also more reliable. The story was at one point required reading for an industrial design course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</description>

	Team,

	Two readings for this week. The primary reading is a short story titled

	Superiority, by Arthur C. Clark. It can be found at the following link:

	<A href="http://www.mayofamily.com/RLM/txt_Clarke_Superiority.html" target="blank" class="std" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'LPD', 'Embed Link', 'http://www.mayofamily.com/RLM/txt_Clarke_Superiority.html');">http://www.mayofamily.com/RLM/txt_Clarke_Superiority.html <img src="../app_Imgs/link_newwin.png" alt="Opens a new tab or window" class="link"></a>

	The second reading is an article by Ben FitzGerald. He uses Clark's story to

	wonder: what if the pursuit of military technical superiority becomes a

	downfall? FitzGerald concludes, "The United States relies on technical

	superiority to maintain its military advantage. But this technical

	superiority requires humans to generate the right strategies, design and

	build the right technologies, devise concepts of operations, and train

	forces to operate the technology to achieve strategic and tactical

	objectives. Sometimes this requires new "leap ahead" technology and

	sometimes it does not." FitzGerald's article can be found at:

	<A href="http://warontherocks.com/2014/12/when-superiority-goes-wrong-science-fiction-and-offset-strategies/" target="blank" class="std" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'LPD', 'Embed Link', 'http://warontherocks.com/2014/12/when-superiority-goes-wrong-science-fiction-and-offset-strategies/');">http://warontherocks.com/2014/12/when-superiority-goes-wrong-science-fiction-and-offset-strategies/ <img src="../app_Imgs/link_newwin.png" alt="Opens a new tab or window" class="link"></a>

	Recognizing that "there are no silver bullet technological solutions," the

	AOC guides our capabilities development efforts. Appendix C, highlights that

	"the Army's differential advantage over enemies derives, in part, from the

	integration of advance technologies with skilled Soldiers and well-trained

	teams." The technological first principles found at the end of Appendix C

	allow us to retain technological advantages without being "crippled by our

	own science."

	I hope you all had a great weekend.

			<author>Ben FitzGerald</author>
		</authors>
		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>For all our talk about the need for military technical superiority, what if pursuit of that goal becomes our downfall? A couple of weeks ago, Bill Sweetman from Aviation Weekly and I were talking about technology development issues and the Pentagon's new offset strategy, the Defense Innovation Initiative. During the conversation he mentioned an Arthur C. Clarke story, Superiority, from 1951 that reminded him of some of our current challenges. Being the nerd that I am, I read it that evening with high hopes.</description>

		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>Briefings by service representatives at recent conferences on military innovation suggest a great deal about what is wrong with the current efforts in the U.S. Department of Defense to foster innovation. One clearly evoked a mass Stakhanovite-like* operation at that service's doctrine center, a program in which the entire staff, from the commander to the lowliest enlisted person, are working twelve hours a day, six days a week, to realize the service chief's vision of innovation. That is unfortunate; it is inconceivable that any valuable thinking, much less progress toward substantial innovation, could be taking place under such conditions.</description>

		<description>The main battle tank of the U.S. Army is under pressure due to critical scrutiny from numerous fronts questioning its relevance to the modern security environment. The M1 Abrams played a key role briefly in Operation Iraqi Freedom and rarely in Operation Enduring Freedom. Moreover, due to an apparent perception within NATO that heavy U.S. armor was no longer needed, the Army redeployed the last of the Abrams based in Europe to the United States in 2013.</description>

		<description>The U.S. Army has a critical, yet largely unaddressed, capability gap. America's primary land force has reduced operations in Southwest Asia and the Middle East after more than a decade of diverse combat operations that ranged from a massed combined arms invasion into Mesopotamia to decentralized mountain patrols in the Hindu Kush. During this time, the infantry brigade combat team (IBCT), the lightest of the Amy's maneuver brigades, has been revealed to be an organization of severely limited tactical and operational utility.</description>

		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>Earlier this year I was on holiday in Corsica and happened to wander into the church of a tiny hamlet in the hills where I found a memorial to the dead from World War I. Out of a population that can have been no more than 150, eight young men, bearing among them only three last names, had died in that conflict. Such lists can be found all over Europe, in great cities and in small villages. Similar memorials are spread around the globe, for the Great War, as it was known prior to 1940, also drew soldiers from Asia, Africa, and North America.</description>

			<![CDATA[

	On the 11th hour, of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, World War I ended. The "war that was to end all wars" was instead the first of two world wars during the bloodiest century in world history. In this essay, Margaret MacMillan argues that history 'rhymes.' She compares geopolitical dynamics today to those that prevailed just prior to World War I. Her essay highlights the unpredictability of war and warfare due to the interaction with enemies as well as the political and human elements of war.  Her essay highlights the need for ready Joint Forces to cope with unforeseen threats as well as realistic scenarios to underpin force development.

	Thank you to all veterans for your service to our nation.

	All the best,

	LTG H. R. McMaster

		<description>This report, France's War in Mali: Lessons for an Expeditionary Army, presents key observations and an analysis of French Army operations in Mali in 2013 as a model for what an expeditionary, regionally aligned force might look like, one that meets a number of U.S. Army desiderata regarding tailorability, scalability at a level lower than a brigade, and light deployment and sustainment requirements. In effect, the U.S. Army arguably could not do what the French did because of a variety of differences. At the very least, those differences would have meant that the Army would have deployed a vastly larger force, with much greater sustainment requirements.</description>

		<description>Although the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are far from the costliest the United States has ever fought in terms of either blood or treasure, they have exacted a much greater toll than the relatively bloodless wars Americans had gotten used to fighting in the 1990s. As of this writing, 2,344 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan and 4,486 in Iraq, and tens of thousands more have been injured. The financial costs reach into the trillions of dollars.</description>

		<description>America's preeminent ground combat capability is the result of the "Big Five" acquisition that produced the Abrams main battle tank, the Bradley fighting vehicle, the Apache attack helicopter, the Black Hawk utility helicopter, and the Patriot air defense missile system. The battle-proven capability of the "Big Five" systems—the mainstay of the Army's combat formations today—demonstrates the success of these programs both individually and collectively. Clearly, the "Big Five" acquisition is perceived as the gold standard.</description>

		<description>Today the nation faces greater strategic uncertainty than at any time since the ending of the Cold War. Adapting in the face of this uncertainty demands a new approach. In decades past, our nation turned to its superior industrial base informed by a robust research and development capability to maintain a decisive edge over any adversary. However, in the coming environment, material solutions alone will not provide the decisive edge against the complex array of rapidly adapting threats we face. To answer the challenge of this new paradigm, the Army must invest in its most valuable resource, its people. Our challenge is to optimize the performance of every Soldier and civilian through innovation and investment in education, training, professionalism, leader development, holistic health and total fitness, talent acquisition and precision talent management of our human capital.</description>

		<description>Our thinking about future wars is often held hostage by the tension between continuity and change. We tend to embrace the known past and continuity with it, sometimes too tightly. But thinking about future wars and preparing the Joint Force for success beyond today's battles has to be based on more than extrapolating from history or clinging to the immutable realities of war. This is not a task for the faint of heart, as Colin Gray notes, "the further away from today one peers and tries to predict, the foggier the course of future events becomes." Certainly we can benefit from deep immersion in history and its lessons, but we also must peek around the bend into the future. Since warfare often presents changes that are more than cosmetic, per Clausewitz, Joint Force developers must continuously balance their search for relevant lessons from the past while scanning for indicators of trends that will yield change in the future.</description>

		<description>The current maturation of the islamic state, or "ISIS" (known in earlier forms as AQI or ISIL or IS) and its demonstrated penchant for barbarity are well known to this committee and need no elaboration here. A review of their origins is helpful to place the current threat in context as we look at what must be done about this clear and present danger. We all recognize that the mid‐east is dissolving into crises and we know terrorism did not start with 9‐11: two fundamental strains of violent islamic jihadists pre‐existed 9‐11 and provide the backdrop for what is manifesting now. Both are dressed in false religious garb.</description>

		<description>(From the Preface by D.L. Morrison, Lieutenant General, Chief of Army) The Army continues to hold a special place in the hearts of Australians through sacrifice and long service to this nation. Although times and technologies have changed, the fundamental mission of the Australian Army endures; to win the land battle. The Army must be able to do this is in order to defeat our enemies and safeguard the interests of the nation and the lives of our people. To carry out these operations effectively, the Army must be multi-skilled, flexible, adaptable, well trained and doctrinally prepared. Our skills must be second to none. As a small force we need to be smarter than our potential enemies. Because of the diversity of threats we face, and their ability to evolve rapidly, we need to prepare ourselves to learn quickly 'on-the-job'.</description>

		<description>Well, thank you for that great introduction, it's wonderful to be back in Australia. I've been coming here - oh my gosh, about 25 years now and it's always wonderful to be back. I see a few of my countrymen here and it's good to see those uniforms as well. I should make one little correction to the introduction, because I live in mortal dread of three women, my wife and my two daughters, one of whom is a naval officer. So this is a joint presentation. It's an honour to be here. I will say, I do feel a little bit funny address a bunch of combat veterans, particularly in army, about land warfare and I feel little like a professor of theoretical carpentry who has been called upon to deliver a narration to the Greater Australian Word Working Association, but I will try to do something - something useful.</description>

		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>For more than a decade, I have been recording reflections about the course of the so-called "Long War" launched after the tragic events of 9/11. These are based on many unique experiences: being the recorder for the 2002 Army After Action Review on Operations Enduring Freedom and Noble Eagle, developing prewar Army plans to reconstruct Iraq, serving as lead author for the 2006 version of Army/Marine Corps Field Manual 3-24 on counterinsurgency, visiting Iraq in 2007 for General David Petraeus, working on projects analyzing wartime assessment and war termination for the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Army Training and Doctrine Command, and innumerable conversations with insightful civilian and military veterans returned from the field. This commentary has also been shaped by many international travels and my own reading of history. I hope to provoke more critical thought about where the American military has been and where it should be going.</description>

	Dr. Crane's essay below is consistent with our work on the Army Operating Concept. His analysis highlights the need for us to consider threats, missions, technology, and history as we develop the future force. For example, his essay reinforces the following.

	- The impact of social media and what our G2 has termed the increased momentum and velocity of human interaction.

	- The enemy has a say in the course of events; war remains fundamentally uncertain.

	- The need to develop situational understanding in close contact with the enemy and civilian populations.

	- The need to consolidate gains as an integral part of war.

	- Targeting is not a strategy -- the need to project national power and maneuver to retain the initiative on multiple 'battlegrounds' (e.g. perception/information, governance and rule of law, political subversion).

	- The need for ground forces to win the perception fight by clarifying intentions, countering enemy disinformation, etc.

	- The need for SF-GPF integration across the range of military operations.

		<description>We have entered a particularly dangerous era in the Near East and South Asia— that is, the Greater Middle East. The context of today's situation is more alarming than respective current crises—as bad as they may be. Rather, there is an increasingly radicalized and violent sectarian environment made up of crosscutting crises occurring in the midst of proliferation; precision weapons; cyber war; increased ungoverned territory vulnerable to global, regional, and local jihadist exploitation; majoritarian authoritarianism; uncompromising sectarianism; ethnic, tribal, and sectarian-driven civil wars; massive popular anger and frustration over the lack of essential services and a diminishing quality of life, particularly in areas such as water, electricity, health, education, employment, and economic collapse; water wars and environmental endangerment; and the vulnerability of sensitive infrastructure targeted by state and nonstate actors, or an empowered lone wolf in the service of a state or nonstate actors.</description>

		<description>In the first half of the 20th century alone, the world experienced two devastating world wars, the rise of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian menace, and the advent of the nuclear age. This grim history and the threats to America and her interests following World War II prompted America's leaders to employ our extraordinary economic, diplomatic and military power to establish and support the current rules-based international order that has greatly furthered global peace and prosperity and ushered in an era of post-war affluence for the American people. This order is not self-sustaining; it requires active, robust American engagement and sustained contributions by our allies. To be sure, other nations have benefited and will continue to benefit. But make no mistake, America provides this international leadership because it greatly enhances America's own security and prosperity. (8-9)1 There is clearly a cost to this kind of leadership, but nowhere near what America paid in the first half of the 20th century when conflict was allowed to fester and grow until it rose to the level of general war. Indeed, our policy of active global engagement has been so beneficial and is so ingrained that those who would retreat from it have a heavy burden of proof to present an alternative that would better serve the security interests and wellbeing of the United States of America.</description>

        <description>(Taken from the Executive Summary) The book is about managing innovation and overcoming inertia in established enterprises. Its major thesis is that most companies love to innovate but hate to take risk, the net result being lots of me-too innovations that lack economic impact because they do not have the force to distinctively differentiate their offers. Its primary prescription is to pick a single vector of innovation and march so far down it that your competition either cannot or will not follow. The book describes fourteen innovation vectors all told. Different types are privileged at different points in the category maturity life cycle, so that innovation strategy must adapt to life-cycle dynamics. The overall model is used to help management teams winnow down innovation vector choices to one or two and align the bulk of their investment behind that choice.</description>

		<descTitle></descTitle>
		<description>Although Mali has been a major recipient of U.S. military and development programs for almost a decade, in 2012, a known Al Qa'ida affiliate, Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and largely indigenous Islamist allies, Ansar Dine and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), successfully took advantage of Mali's political instability and military weakness to amass power. Mali's vaunted democracy, moreover, collapsed in a military coup, while on the northern battlefields, the Malian Army's performance was disastrous. In other words, all the past assumptions about Mali's political stability, internal cohesion, and military capabilities were revealed to be deeply flawed.</description>

		<description>In the late nineteen-forties, Alex Osborn, a partner in the advertising agency B.B.D.O., decided to write a book in which he shared his creative secrets. At the time, B.B.D.O. was widely regarded as the most innovative firm on Madison Avenue. Born in 1888, Osborn had spent much of his career in Buffalo, where he started out working in newspapers, and his life at B.B.D.O. began when he teamed up with another young adman he'd met volunteering for the United War Work Campaign. By the forties, he was one of the industry's grand old men, ready to pass on the lessons he'd learned.</description>

	This does not mean that Brainstorming is bad. It means, I think we need time on our own to read, think, and write as well as time for "focued" small group work.
