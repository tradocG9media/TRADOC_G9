			<div class="blockcaption" id="cap320">Pictured here are the efficient shelters evaluated by Soldiers of the 4/27th Field Artillery, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, for use as mission-command support infrastructure during NIE 13.2 at Fort Bliss, Texas, and White Sands Missile Range, N.M.</div>
			</div>
<p>Three seasoned noncommissioned officers (NCOs) from the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC), each with four deployments under their belts, explained how they use their experience to ensure that their recommendations on the systems being evaluated and demonstrated during semi-annual Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs) are honest and reflect what Soldiers need to fill capability gaps.</p>
<p>Sgt. 1st Class Luis Pumisacho from New York City and Sgt. 1st Class Alex Diaz from Houston are both senior Field Artillery noncommissioned officers (NCOs) assigned to BMC's Brigade Modernization Integration Division (BMID).  They have both been deployed to Bosnia once and Iraq three times, so they know what is needed to survive on the battlefield.  They also know just how important the ability to communicate is, all the way down to the dismounted Soldier level.  During the past two NIEs, they have been observing the performance of mission command systems under evaluation.</p>
<p>Pumisacho, who worked at Base Operations and Tactical Operations Centers in Iraq, said that these experiences gave him a great appreciation for the need for accurate and reliable communications from brigade to platoon. This applies especially to "Mission Command on the Move," which is a force's ability to continually transmit voice and data communications while moving throughout the operational area. During NIE 13.2, held in May/June of this year, Pumisacho observed a system being evaluated by Soldiers of the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery (4/27th), which is part of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division (2/1 AD). The 2/1 AD is attached to the BMC to conduct NIEs under realistic combat conditions. The Combined Arms Support Command had also sent some of its own representatives to see how the system was being used and how it fared in the combat scenarios.</p>
<p>"The system had efficient shelters for the Base Operations and TOC, which were co-located with current operations," Pumisacho explained. "The commander and his staff were in four tents in the same area," he said, adding, "Soldiers for the most part liked the system, because its generators were less noisy and the tents were easier to set up, using less manpower."</p>
<p>Based partly on Pumisacho's observations and the 4/27th Soldiers' feedback, this system--with some recommended improvements and tweaks--will be evaluated again in NIE 14.1 in October and November of this year, when it will be called the Efficient Mobile Support Infrastructure.  The Mission Command Center of Excellence from Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, will send representatives to observe how the system is employed during realistic combat scenarios.</p>
<p>Asked how he feels about his job, Pumisacho said, "It gives me—a Soldier with 15 to 20 years experience—an opportunity to help find better products for Soldiers.  The NIE environment is as close as possible to real combat, as far as weather, terrain and synchronization go."</p>
<p>Diaz, who works with Pumisacho, echoes those sentiments.  He pointed out that since the reason for conducting the NIE is to obtain Soldier feedback, "if we don't listen to what they have to say, we would be wasting resources."</p>
<p>Sgt. 1st Class David Taylor from Panama City, Fla., also assigned to BMID, has had three tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.  For his first two combat tours in Iraq, he worked in Signal Corps jobs, but during his last tour in Iraq and the one in Afghanistan, he served in his current military occupational specialty of 15W, Shadow Unmanned Aerial System Operator. In these positions, he really got a first-hand look at the importance of communication from the "aerial tier," that is, from helicopters in the air to units on the ground.</p>
<p>"This will be my third NIE," he said, referring to NIE 14.1. "NIE 13.1 was my first, where I worked with the GNOMAD, a router that took different system software and operated as a 'Mission-Command on the Move' system. We discovered that it worked best in the Caiman MRAP [Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected] vehicle, because it provided better situational awareness of the battlefield.  The worst feature was that it could be a single point of failure, if it went down where there was no redundancy," he noted.  He said that the system showed enough promise to participate in the next NIE, 13.2, though it was only used in a lab setting instead of in combat scenarios, and he was not directly involved with it.</p>
<p>"I worked on the Roamer system demonstration, which was a concept for the aerial tier for aviation and can communicate through SINCGARS [Single-Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System], which is being replaced by software-based waveform radios."</p>
<p>"The Roamer system was meant to create a bridge from aviation assets (such as helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft) through a radio to a ground Soldier's level," he said. Taylor noted that this will be the third NIE that the Roamer will be participating in, and he expects to see some of the recommended improvements from Soldier feedback incorporated in the latest version, which should help to get communication from the aerial tier down to the dismounted Soldier level.</p>
<p>Asked about how it is working with the Soldiers of the 2/1 AD, he said that the leadership—especially senior officers and NCOs--has plenty of recent combat experience, so they also know and appreciate the importance of a reliable, accurate network to tie in all the systems used on the battlefield.  This, he said, makes his job of getting good feedback on the evaluated systems much easier.</p>
