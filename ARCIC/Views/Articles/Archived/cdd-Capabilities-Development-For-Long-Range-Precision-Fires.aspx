<p>This paper describes the Army's long range precision fires (LRPF) capabilities, their demonstrated value in joint operations, potential LRPF roles in the evolving joint operating environment, and Army modernization initiatives to adapt them to joint commanders' future needs</p>
<p>The Army's LRPF capabilities are the longer range (270+ km) Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and the shorter range (70+ Km) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) - both launched from the same two air-transportable, ground mobile systems.  They are uniquely versatile complements to the mix of joint munitions available to division, corps and joint units - enabling them to immediately employ significant quantities of highly responsive, all-weather, long range precision fires across the range of military operations.  GMLRS and ATACMS variants deliver either a single high explosive "unitary" or cluster munition warhead against point and area targets.</p>

<p>In Korea, these systems have represented the greatest quantity of forward positioned, immediately available joint long range munitions available to deter and respond to North Korean aggression.  In OIF ATACMS effectively neutralized enemy IADS, enabling achievement of initial air superiority; ATACMS and GMLRS played key roles supporting rapid land forces maneuver. In Iraq and Afghanistan over 3000 GMLRS and 85 ATACMS have been fired in support of joint combat operations. Their demonstrated precision has made them invaluable in urban terrain, where collateral damage is sometimes a concern.  Special operations forces, in particular, have relied upon them as unique, air-transportable, highly responsive means to conduct raids - delivering out-of-nowhere devastating effects against both area and point time-sensitive targets at long range – whenever and wherever needed.</p>

<p class="BubbleTitleSection">LRPF Potential Contributions in the Changing Operating Environment</p>
<p>As adversaries continue to employ anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) capabilities to hinder or deny access to regions important to us, our allies and partners joint commanders responsible for neutralizing these capabilities in combat continue to cite their need for Army LRPF systems.  U.S. Forces Korea, USARPAC, ARCENT and USASOC have recognized the Army's unique LRPF attributes and potential future operational contributions in their respective areas of responsibility.   Because U.S. military strategy emphasizes the importance on A2/AD in the PACOM AOR the DoD is keenly interested in determining potential roles for Army rockets and missiles.</p>
<p>The potential for future Army LRPF roles in the PACOM A2/AD operating environment can be appreciated by understanding the many years of successful U.S. engagement and forward deployment of LRPF systems in forward presence and deterrence operations in Korea.  Long term U.S.–ROK engagement has involved LRPF roles in war games, experiments, multi-national science/technology initiatives and cooperative capabilities development.  One key result is that U.S. and Korean commanders have clear and mutually supporting responsibilities and common priorities for employment of LRPF systems.  Their LRPF missions include detailed deliberate and dynamic targeting of enemy air missile defenses and other A2/AD targets, long range high value targets, and time sensitive attack in support of offensive and defensive land forces maneuver and special operations forces.</p>

<p>LRPF has high potential as a future complementary joint fires capability in the expansive PACOM AOR.  It has unique attributes that will enable U.S. commanders to prevail with fires on and between large, dispersed land masses interspersed with sea lanes.  These attributes provide LRPF key advantages over other joint fires systems:  immediately available in significant quantities to U.S. and allied/partner commanders; permanent deterrence presence paired with small logistic footprint, mobility to respond to tactically dispersed operations; rapidly transportable within and between regions and theaters; responsiveness to requested fires; full functionality in all-weather conditions, high survivability and lethality against enemy A2/AD threats.  LRPF's contribution to operational and strategic level defenses in the ROK is an example of the successful achievement of Joint Operational Concept's imperative for delivering fires in depth.  Army LRPF systems demonstrate how joint fires can be forward positioned and adaptively employed to deter and respond to aggression against an ally / partner in what is always a unique A2/AD environment.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Challenges to Army LRPF Capabilities</p>
<p>Sustainment of a robust Army LRPF capability is being adversely impacted by two factors.  First, as a result of a 2007 fiscally-based decision, the Army terminated the ATACMS program; inventories of both unitary and cluster munition warhead missiles are decreasing with time.  Second, the Department of Defense (DoD) Policy on Cluster Munitions bans the use of non-compliant systems after 31 Dec 2018; this will further decrease LRPF inventories.   DoD is pursuing studies to determine if, when, and the quantity of Army LRPF systems and alternate (area effects) warheads will be developed and fielded.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">LRPF Capabilities Development Modernization</p>
<p>The Army has two major LRPF modernization efforts underway to address long range fires gaps - the GMLRS Alternate Warhead (GMLRS-AW) and the ATACMS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  Other possibilities are being evaluated as complementary mitigating solutions as well.</p>
<p>The GMLRS-AW (Figure 4) will replace banned MLRS with current cluster munitions effective 31 Dec 2018.  GMLRS-AW provides a persistent capability to deliver area effects, similar to the munitions it replaces, to ranges greater than 70 Km.  Initial developmental testing flights have been successful.  The program is meeting all performance requirements and is on schedule to provide an initial operational capability 2016.</p>

<p>The ATACMS SLEP missile (Figure 5) is a "bridging" initiative that will provide time to complete analysis and development of a successor capability to the aging ATACMS stockpile, and non-compliant CM missiles. The SLEP will refurbish/replace propulsion and navigation systems; replace the non-compliant anti-personnel/anti-materiel warhead with the current unitary blast/fragmentation warhead, and add a proximity fuze option to obtain area effects.</p>

<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Science &amp; Technology</p>
<p>Combat developers at all levels collaborate with the Army Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) community to identify realm-of-the-possible LRPF solutions to address capability gaps.   Attributes being explored include an active radar guidance system, in-flight communications uplink to joint sensors, and maritime autonomous target recognition (ATR).  Improvements in technologies are contributing to the feasibility of longer range multi-use systems, such as new propellant and explosive energetics that enable reductions in weight, size and increased range. Analysis of possible system alternatives, combined with associated cost and performance attributes, will assist the LRPF combat developments community in determining courses of action to pursue.  USARPAC sees potential to collaborate with maritime forces in theater to develop ground-based anti-ship missiles for use in coastal defense and interdiction of warships.   The on-going OSD-directed LRPF Analysis of Alternatives will inform future senior Army and Office of Secretary of Defense leadership decisions on S&amp;T and program investments to address the Army's and Joint Force LRFP needs.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Summary</p>
<p>The changing strategic, operational and threat environments demand modernization of current Army LRPF capabilities.  The aging ATACMS stockpile and loss of non-compliant CM missiles challenge DoD's ability to provide LRPF overmatch.  The Army and Fires warfighting function modernization proponent is addressing the challenges with an initial operating capability for GMLRS-AW in 2016, and ATACMS SLEP deliveries projected to start in 2018.   LRPF AoA results, projected for Mar 2015, will inform DoD leadership decisions on which DOTLMPF course of action to pursue.  A new missile solution could be ready in the 2022 timeframe in support of Joint, A2/AD and Army 2025 and beyond initiatives.</p>
<blockquote>The final objective in war is the destruction of the enemy's capacity and will to fight, and thereby force him to accept the imposition of the victor's will …
…The optimum of pressure is exerted through that absolute control obtained by actual physical occupation. This optimum is obtainable only on land where physical occupation can be consolidated and maintained.<br />~Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, on his day of Departure as Chief of Naval Operations</blockquote>
