    <p>The US Army's Training and Doctrine Command laid out its "Big 8" initiatives Wednesday during the Association of the US Army's Global Force Symposium.
        He shared a list of eight capabilities that service leaders should prioritize in acquisition programs, stating “Our intention is … to focus force modernization on the Army’s most critical gaps.” 
        The goal of the Big 8 is to stay ahead of global threats and maintain overmatch against present and future adversaries... Maj. Gen. Bo Dyess, the Army Capabilities Integration Center's deputy director, said requirements for the initiatives will be generated based on the construct of the Army Warfighting Challenges and through lead integrators at the Centers of Excellence and other commands. 
        Then TRADOC will take recommendations to Army leadership on which resources should be prioritized based on what the organization believes are the biggest gaps in the near-, mid- and long-term. And a more nimble Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC), with the Army chief and vice chief at the epicenter, should move initiatives into programs in a more effective way.
