                The U.S. Army Operating Concept, Win in a Complex World and the Army Warfighting
                Challenges (AWFC) describe how future Army forces operate to accomplish campaign
                objectives and protect United States national interests. Intelligence assessments
                and the Army family of concepts, along with strategy and planning documents, tell
                us that, within this environment, the IED will remain an enduring threat ─ “the
                single most effective countermeasure to U.S. Army advantages in armor protection,
                mobility, firepower and survivability…” (Army Counter Explosive Improvised Device
                Campaign Plan). General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, further
                stated: “Improvised explosive devices remain the single most dangerous threat to
                our soldiers—all branches and all ranks—on the battlefield. They are very clearly
                an enduring threat.” The Army Capability Integration Center (ARCIC), in concert
                with the Training and Doctrine Command’s Centers of Excellence (CoE), is leading
                the effort to mitigate this threat and promote freedom of action, preservation of
                combat power and an enhanced security environment.

                C-IEDs and Explosive Hazards
            </h3>
            <p>
                As the Army draws down in the wake of Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom, and
                coupled with an increasingly constrained fiscal environment, the Army faces difficult
                decisions. In this decision process, the Army must preserve C-IED lessons learned
                and enduring capabilities developed during 13 years of combat. ARCIC is fully engaged
                to ensure lessons learned and C-IED enduring capabilities become the baseline to
                posture Force 2025 and Beyond. ARCIC is also expanding its focus to the larger explosive
                hazard (EH) threat, of which IEDs are a sub-set. In the past, EHs were addressed
                primarily through rapid acquisition processes, resulting in a proliferation of non-standard
                equipment. However, what worked in the past cannot be sustained, especially in light
                of fiscal realities. With anticipated reductions in end strength, ARCIC is providing
                analysis and integration for prioritization of future and current needs and supporting
                trade-space decisions to reduce the force while developing Army combat capabilities
                for the future.

                ARCIC is balancing the need for rapid acquisition for the “current fight” and movement
                from reactive, rapid acquisition to a normalized acquisition process for Force 2025
                and Beyond. This transition must be supported with a clear understanding of strategic
                and operational guidance, concepts-based required capabilities, supporting tasks,
                and analysis of capability gaps and their associated risks. Visibility into existing
                and potential Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education,
                Personnel and Facilities (DOTMPLF) solutions is critical. Integration, synchronization
                and governance are also companion processes required to coordinate the delivery
                of capabilities to the warfighter. ARCIC’s recent C-IED Current-to Enduring Capability
                Transition Analysis is an important first step in providing this visibility and
                is available from ARCIC’s Maneuver Support and Protection Division (MSPD).

            <h3>
                Counter-EH (CEH) Concept-to-Capability Visibility
            </h3>
            <p>
                To support concept-to-capability visibility and the institutionalization of current-to-enduring
                capabilities, ARCIC’s C-IED Current-to-Enduring Capabilities Transition Analysis
                conducted a three-part analysis. The analysis provided a holistic and integrated
                view of Joint and Service C-IED direction and guidance, required capabilities, tasks,
                capability gaps and prioritization, recommended solutions for gap mitigation, and
                acquisition and programmatic status of enduring Army C-IED programs. ARCIC’s analysis
                also identified ten findings and associated recommendations for further action.
                These recommendations range from development of integrated EH required capabilities
                in the Army Functional Concepts (AFC), to detailed EH development in the Army’s
                Capability Needs Analysis (CNA), to options for improved EH integration and synchronization
                across Centers of Excellence and their Capability Development Integration Directorates.
                <h3>
                    Where It all Comes Together; Where We Think We Can Improve</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking beyond ARCIC’s C-IED Current-to-Enduring Capabilities Transition Analysis,
                ARCIC sees a target rich environment for synchronization and integration of efforts
                across the CEH community for defining future requirements, building enduring capabilities,
                improving representation in the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process and providing
                concept-to-capability visibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                The below figure depicts the concept-to-capability process. It begins with the Army
                Concept Framework of which the Army Operating Concept (AOC) and Army Functional
                Concepts (AFC) are key documents. The new AOC and its Army Warfighting Challenges
                are the centerpiece, starting point and driving force for evolutionary and innovative
                development of Force 2025 and Beyond. As stated by General Raymond Odierno, the
                Army Chief of Staff, “the AOC provides the intellectual foundation and framework
                for learning and for applying what we learn to future force development under Force
                2025 and Beyond.” The AOC derives 20 AWFCs that represent first-order required capabilities.
                These first-order required capabilities are intentionally broad. The AFCs further
                define the AWFC-aligned required capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                CEH required capability identification in the AFCs is the CEH community’s first
                opportunity in 2015 to drive CEH specific capability development and “get it right.”
                The AFCs are currently under revision. CEH required capabilities in the AFCs need
                to be detailed, clearly defined and integrated and synchronized across the CoEs.
                Inputs for AFC required capabilities need to be inclusive, incorporating CoE analysis
                along with inputs from Joint and Service capability-based assessments. It should
                also consider Joint Requirement Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM 004-13) guidance
                that established the 6 C-IED Enduring Capabilities and 18 Operational Tasks and
                apply them to CEH required capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second opportunity to drive CEH specific capability development is in the annual
                CNA process. ARCIC directs the CNA process and incorporates the AWFCs and detailed
                AFC required capabilities. Associated tasks, conditions and standards are identified
                leading to define capability gaps and mitigating recommended solutions identification.
                CEH tasks must be specific, detailed and clearly defined. Detailed tasks along with
                their linkage to conditions and standards are the foundation to capability gap identification.
                Well-developed tasks lead to accurate CNA gap identification, prioritization and
                solution mitigation. They also help provide consistency and correlation between
                CNA and existing C-IED and EH Joint Capability Integration Development System capability-based
                assessments and documentation. Task inputs should again be inclusive with inputs
                from CoE analysis and the Army Universal Task List (AUTL) and consider the JROCM
                18 C-IED Operational tasks. The CNA derived gap identification and prioritization,
                along with mitigating recommended solutions, provide input to Campaign of Learning
                and acquisition and POMing processes, to include Capability Portfolio Reviews (CPRs)
                and Long Range Investment Requirement Analysis (LIRAs).</p>
            <p>
                The third opportunity to drive CEH capability development in 2015 resides in the
                annual Joint C-IED Portfolio Review. This Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)
                directed event coordinates Service C-IED portfolio inputs and correlates these capabilities
                into a Joint portfolio for Joint C-IED capability gap analysis. ARCIC works in close
                coordination with the Maneuver Support CoE to help provide an integrated view of
                Army capabilities and funding streams.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Governance; the Key to Transition</h3>
            <p>
                The Army will always be faced with “current fight” threats and challenges and a
                need for rapid acquisition processes. However, the Army must transition from a “current
                fight” C-IED focus to the enduring CEH effort for Force 2025 and Beyond. This will
                require an expanded CEH focus and improved integration and synchronization across
                the entire CEH community to re-focus the means and processes from the “current fight”
                to the long-term, enduring effort. This is an ideal mission for Army governance
                and the governance leads along with ARCIC in its integration responsibilities. As
                a starting point, ARCIC’s C-IED Current-to Enduring Capability Transition Analysis,
                available through MSPD, provides findings and recommendations for consideration.
                As a way-ahead, ARCIC is actively pursuing its integration responsibilities to team
                with the CoEs to address these issues, pursue CEH opportunities in 2015’s target
                rich environment, and foster closer collaboration across the CEH community. The
                end-state is improved CEH capabilities for the Soldier. Combat development is where
                we win or lose in the POM. We must get it right!
