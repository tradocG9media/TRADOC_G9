<p>By Mr Stephen Murray, Requirements Integration Directorate (RID), LandWarNet Division (LWND), June 20, 2014</p>
<p>The Network remains one of the Army's top modernization priorities. Army forces require a coherent and integrated network capability to move information seamlessly under universal conditions and support all phases of Joint operations.</p>

<p>LandWarNet enables warfighting and generating force functions by providing a manageable, interoperable, integrated, network enterprise from Post / Camp / Station to the tactical edge that connects all of our forces, systems, platforms, and installations into a collaborative environment.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">What is LandWarNet?</p>
<p>LandWarNet is the Army's enterprise network -- a secure, standards-based, versatile infrastructure linked by networked, redundant transport systems, sensors, warfighting and business applications to provide our Soldiers, civilians and unified action partners the information they need, when they need it, in any environment. It provides connectivity to both classified and unclassified networks at post/camp/station, at home, when deployed, TDY, or in austere locations. LandWarNet is also part of the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN); interconnected to the overarching joint information environment that includes networks and services for each military service, federal agencies, in the Department of Defense. (See Figure 1)</p>

<p>In the coming months and years, LandWarNet will transform the Army's Networks into a single, more versatile infrastructure that links networking devices and services across the Army; whether the need is on the battlefield today, training for the next deployment, education, sustaining fielded equipment, or collaborating with counterparts around the world. LandWarNet is focused on three primary objectives: build capacity, improve security and deliver enterprise services to the entire force.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Where are we now with LandWarNet?</p>
<p>ARCIC, along with the Cyber Center of Excellence, has championed the LandWarNet Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that establishes and describes (in broad terms) LandWarNet as the Army's portion of the DoDIN.  The ICD specifically states its purpose is to "...provide an overarching framework to develop evolving and existing enterprise capabilities into the Army's future network providing a single, secure, network supporting the Joint Information Environment (JIE)."  Recently, the LandWarNet ICD was indorsed by the Functional Capability Board (FCB) pending final approval by the Joint Staff. This and follow-on efforts allow the transformation, which has already begun, to 'pick up steam' across the global enterprise.</p>
<p>The five required capabilities listed within the ICD provide the Army network with the ability to connect, move information seamlessly and significantly improve network defense. First, establish unity of command and unity of effort through common policies and standards; next, enable Army and unified action partners operations to assure the computing and communications resources, services, and information are available, accessible and safe-guarded; provide assured information and services to ensure that the Army, unified action partners and mission partners are provided timely assured global access to required data and services; authentication, availability, confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation through identity management ensures that authorized users or systems can access the network during normal, degraded, and disconnected conditions with a trusted, single identity; finally, defend the LandWarNet which describes actions taken to dynamically monitor, detect, analyze, respond, secure and protect against attack and unauthorized activity, as well as identifying unintentional, non-malicious user errors.</p>
<p>As LandWarNet evolves it will be governed and managed to mirror efforts in the joint community.  Redesigned software applications will fit a common framework/architecture so all DoD will be interconnected in a Joint information environment.  For instance, Enterprise Email, implemented across the Army, is a common enterprise email service to be implemented across all military services just like data service centers and CAC card connecting services.  Centrally stored data enables users to access their 'library of information' from any location.  This is but one example of the power harnessed by technology and upgrades under development to improve LandWarNet.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Conclusion</p>
<p>Today, ARCIC is leading the way; teamed with Army, other Services and industry partners, to build a vibrant, extendable, enterprise network capability. This transformation will impact all networked systems including satellites, data storage and web services [cloud computing], computers, sensors and wireless devices across the Army - enabling Soldiers and Civilians to stay connected and achieve decisive results.</p>
