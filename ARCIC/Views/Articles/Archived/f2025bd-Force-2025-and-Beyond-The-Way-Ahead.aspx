<p><i>From ARMY Magazine, Vol. 65, No. 2, February 2015. Copyright 2015 by the Association of the U.S. Army and reprinted by permission of ARMY Magazine.</i></p>
<p>The Army is engaged in a significant effort to ensure that the future force is prepared to defend the nation and accomplish missions across the full range of military operations. Simply put, future Army forces must be prepared to win in a complex world, to borrow the title of the TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1. What follows is an outline of the way ahead for our Force 2025 and beyond campaign—how the Army will think, learn, adapt, evolve and innovate over roughly the next 25 years.</p>
<p>The strategic and operational necessity for transformation will likely build until about 2040, when warfare will require a fundamentally different force than the one we have today. Some trends we see today are likely to continue. For example, individuals and nonstate actors, terrorists, and nationalistic organizations will continue to take advantage of technologies to become more lethal and to have more global reach. The cyber domain will become more contested. Demographic trends will likely continue to spark conflict as populations expand along with the expectation of those populations, while resources become increasingly scarce in many regions of the world.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Look Back to Look Ahead</p>
<p>In thinking through the way ahead, we looked back at similar successful efforts by the Army. The 1980s transformation to the AirlLand Battle strategy for warfighting was one of the Army's greatest achievements, but it is time to do it all over again. In developing the Army for AirLand Battle, we took a comprehensive, holistic approach. Leading with an AirLand Battle Concept and doctrine as published in the 1982 Field Manual 100-5 Operations, we significantly improved our technological capabilities through acquisition of the Big 5: the Abrams tank, Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, Apache attack helicopter, Black Hawk helicopter and Patriot air defense missile system.</p>
<p>The Army transformation, however, was much more than that. The combat training centers and Battalion Training Management System, just to name two efforts, significantly improved training, while the Army's School of Advanced Military Studies and a comprehensive Noncommissioned Officer Education System made Army professional military education the envy of the world. Divisional reorganization gave our combat formations renewed flexibility for mobile, sustained combat.</p>
<p>After more than a decade of major combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army needs to make another transformation. Today's complex world requires more than simply having better weapons systems and platforms. <asp:HyperLink runat="server"

		ImageUrl="~/app_Imgs/link_newwin.png"
		AlternateText="Opens a new tab or window"
		CssClass="link" /></asp:HyperLink>, recognizes the need for future Army forces to support joint force freedom of movement and action through the projection of power from land across the air, maritime, space and cyberspace domains. The document guides future force development through the identification of first-order capabilities that the Army must possess to accomplish missions in support of policy goals and objectives. Complementary to this effort and the best technology and systems, we must have a force that enables the Army to win in a complex world in which the future adversaries, future missions and future conditions are uncertain.</p>
<p>Just as AirLand Battle took a comprehensive approach, the Force 2025 and Beyond campaign includes a new Big 5 that focuses on more than just weapons systems in order to develop the adaptive, effective, professional force aimed at the critical capabilities we must develop and enhance over the next decade. Key among these are the capabilities that address the human dimension, including optimizing soldier and team performance and developing adaptive professionals and organizations. In that these Army elements are always members of a broader strategy, our Big 5 includes developing scalable and tailorable joint and combined arms formations and enhancing joint and organizational interoperability. In addition, because technology remains an important component of future force capabilities, we must ensure that we retain capabilities overmatch in critical systems, weapons, information and protection technologies, and fielded materiel.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">What Will Make It Work?</p>
<p>The key to making Force 2025 work is integrating the initiatives into existing Army processes and across all defense-wide guidance for resolving capabilities gaps in warfighting. It cannot happen all at once because the Army—active, Guard, Reserve and civilian—is one of the nation's largest organizations and it needs to be fully functional throughout the transformation process. Still, success in Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989 and in Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991 showed the Army is capable of dramatic course-changing transitions.</p>
<p>Ensuring that future Army forces are prepared to win in a complex world requires a focused, sustained and collaborative effort across the institutional Army, the operating force, the joint community, industry, academia, and other inter-organizational and multinational partners. To enable such integration, our <asp:HyperLink runat="server"
				Text="Army Warfighting Challenges"
				NavigateUrl="~/Initiatives/army-warfighting-challenges.aspx"
				CssClass="std" /> provide an analytical framework to integrate efforts across warfighting functions while collaborating with key stakeholders in learning activities, modernization and future force design.</p>
<p>Force 2025 and Beyond Maneuvers is the Army's Campaign of Learning and the engine driving our ability to adapt, evolve and innovate. These are the physical (experimentation, evaluation, exercises, modeling, simulations and war games) and intellectual (studies, analysis, concept and capabilities development) activities that help leaders develop interim solutions to warfighting challenges and discover innovative ways to expand capabilities in the future. We must assess our efforts continuously and be prepared to adapt to unexpected opportunities and unanticipated dangers.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">The New Big 5</p>
<ul class="body">
	<li class="body">Optimized soldier and team performance</li>

	<li class="body">Capabilities overmatch</li>

	<li class="body">Joint and organizational interoperability</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have learned anything from our transformation efforts, such as AirLand Battle and Force XXI, it is that changing an organization as large and complex as the Army requires collaborative leadership across the force and at every echelon. In order to maximize initiative and innovation, bottom-up input with top-down guidance is critical The Force 2025 governance aims to ensure that collaboration and communication with all stakeholders occur and inform Army processes.</p>
<p>We will transform so we can execute a new operating concept that will enable the Army to provide the nation with forces that can win the fight for geography, information and ideas. As outlined here, we have embarked on a deliberate campaign of Force 2025 and Beyond that will lead innovative transformation from the Army we have today to the Army the nation needs for the future.</p>
