<p>By COL Vance P. Visser, Chief, ARCIC, RID, Maneuver Support Protection Division, November 12, 2013</p>
<p>The existing threat to the United States posed by Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) is significant and growing.  At least 17 countries maintain sizeable chemical/biological weapons stockpiles and many, such as North Korea, possess amounts exceeding two metric tons.  The threat of conventional nuclear attack remains a national security concern.</p>

			</div>
<p>In October 2013, the Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) established the Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) working group, a cooperative effort co-chaired by Maneuver Support Protection Division (MSPD) and the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE) Capabilities Development and Integration Directorate (CDID).  The mission of the working group is to integrate the multiple CWMD efforts that are being undertaken by ARCIC.  ARCIC has developed an aggressive timeline for completion of the group's initial requirements:  develop the draft Army Concept (AC) for CWMD by November 2013; conduct a CWMD Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) Assessment by 31 Dec 13; conduct a CWMD Integration Assessment by mid-February 2014; and conduct a CWMD Capabilities Based Assessment by March 2014.</p>
<p>Many nations are capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the United States.  Thirty-two countries have at least one kilogram of weapons-grade nuclear material, 28 of these are countries of concern (two are closed, insular societies openly hostile to the United States; two are failed or failing states; and 24 have security deficiencies involving their nuclear material).  The resulting electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from even a small nuclear weapon could significantly impair electronics- an extremely high-impact event in the Information Age.  The availability of non-weaponized radiological material, which can be combined with an explosive device to create a "dirty bomb," increases with years of generated nuclear waste.</p>
<p>Thus, the Army must clearly define CWMD requirements across formations, determine existing and future capability gaps, and implement technologically and fiscally feasible solutions to help stop the proliferation of WMD and associated technologies, and when necessary, decisively engage the threat by employing CWMD counter-force operations.</p>
<p>The future operational environment will comprise more complex and integrated WMD threats than we see currently.  Threat networks will be transnational -- employing dual-use products and technologies to avoid detection and counter-action.  Rogue states may pursue biological weapons programs under the cover of legitimate biotechnology activities.  Aging nuclear reactors are vulnerable to catastrophic failure.  Non-state actors will likely seek to develop or acquire biological and radiological/nuclear weapons.  Failed states, and the potential loss of control of CBRN materials that can be used as WMD, will present the major CWMD challenge.</p>
<p>Given these current and near-future threats, CWMD can no longer be viewed as a niche consequence management capability delivered by the CBRN Officer/NCO or the CBRN Company after a WMD attack.  As WMD dangers increase in both scope (i.e., variety of WMD weapons) and scale (i.e., number of WMD actors), CWMD must become a primary Army focus that encompasses all war-fighting functions.  The United States must make a concerted effort involving all law enforcement, Homeland Security, and DoD agencies to counter WMD threats before they are employed.  This will be done through a total government effort that focuses on the four CWMD functions:  WMD proliferation-prevention, WMD counter-force, WMD defense, and WMD consequence-management.</p>
<p>Countering WMD proliferation and use requires Army forces to accomplish many missions:
<ul class="body">
	<li class="body">Monitor, detect, and interdict the production, transfer, or employment of WMD technologies and devices</li>
	<li class="body">Secure production and storage facilities in the event of collapse of a WMD capable state</li>
	<li class="body">Increase the capacity of partner nations to protect WMD technologies and devices from internal and external threats</li>
	<li class="body">Use or develop standoff detection and surveillance capabilities</li>
	<li class="body">Neutralize or render safe devices and their components.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>All of these requirements are achieved through the performance of Army CWMD operations.  Army CWMD operations support sustained engagement activities to increase partner security capacity, improve visibility of current and emerging threats, and contribute to combatant commander theater security cooperation efforts.</p>

<p>In the future, the Army's role in CWMD will continue to grow, and the Army will lead and execute CWMD missions focused on operations that prevent the use of WMD.  The focus of CWMD shifts from post-use (right of boom) Consequence Management to pre-use (left of boom) denial.</p>
<p>In support of this, ARCIC has initiated multiple efforts that will identify required capabilities for both the current and future forces to execute all CWMD functions.  The MSPD, Requirements Integration Division (RID), completed a Radiological and Nuclear Interdiction (RNI) DOTMLPF Policy (DOTMLPF-P) study in November of 2012 that focused on the Conventional Force (CF) ability to detect and interdict RN materials.  Additionally, MSPD will complete a similar study by February of 2014 that will assess CF capability to detect and interdict chemical materials.</p>
