			</div>
<p>The Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) is the lead in providing U.S. Army input into the development of Joint Concepts.  Over the past two years, ARCIC has provided indispensable Army future capabilities input in the writing of Joint Concepts such as the Joint Operational Access Concept (JOAC), and draft concepts on Entry Operations as well as Rapid Aggregation. Working with the Joint Staff (J7) as lead, and alongside sister services, ARCIC's input in the development of joint concepts ensures that Army equities are represented and maintained.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">The Anti-Access / Area-Denial Challenge</p>
<p>The National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, Quadrennial Defense Review, National Military Strategy, and FY2013-17 Defense Planning Guidance all highlight that potential future adversaries are adopting advanced anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) technologies of growing lethality.  The proliferation of these capabilities challenges U.S. freedom of action.</p>
<p>The JOAC also addresses this overarching A2/AD challenge.  Based on insights from the JOAC development, however, there remained conceptual gaps in how to conduct entry operations in these A2/AD environments, notably the entry of land forces against the threat of armed opposition. This is especially critical to a continental U.S. (CONUS)-based military that is expected to rely more on power projection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the joint force's ability to project power and influence is increasingly challenged by the proliferation of technologies in advanced tracking and targeting, and by both state and non-state actors' ability to integrate these technologies, weapons, and tactics to prevent the access of U.S. forces into the operational area.  As adversaries' state-of-the-art A2/AD capabilities become more prevalent, entry operations become more critical.</p>
<p>Joint Operational Access is the ability of Joint Forces in concert with Unified Action partners to overcome military impediments to operational access; it is a critical enabler for extending U.S. influence and projecting power overseas.  As noted in the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO), "The most likely occasions requiring the commitment of joint forces will arise, as they have for the past half-century, in places where few or no forces are permanently stationed. America's ability to project power rapidly and conduct and sustain operations globally thus will remain critically dependent on air and maritime freedom of movement and on sufficient strategic and operational lift."</p>
<p>Current joint concepts and doctrine do not adequately address entry operations in the future operational environment, nor do they identify required capabilities in sufficient detail to develop solutions across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF). The JOAC's emphasis on cross-domain synergy requires that an entry operations concept further assess space and cyberspace domains.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">A New Concept to Close the Capability Gap</p>
<p>Recognizing these gaps, Training and Doctrine Command Commanding General Gen. Robert Cone directed ARCIC to begin work on the Joint Concept for Entry Operations (JCEO) as soon as possible to address these issues and continue developmental work that would support the JOAC.</p>
<p>The JCEO provides an operational-level description of how the future joint force will conduct entry operations in an opposed access environment circa 2020.  The JCEO incorporates the central thesis and precepts of the CCJO as well as the JOAC to the challenge of opposed entry.</p>
<p>Operational experience gained over the past three decades indicate the future joint force must enter onto foreign territory for a number of purposes to enable broader strategic goals. The Joint Entry Operations Concept emphasizes the unique nature the purpose has on the actual conduct of a particular entry operation.</p>
<p>Joint Entry Operations addresses the conduct of future entry operations in 2020 and beyond, the capabilities the future Joint Force requires to execute them, and the associated risks. The JCEO broadens the scope beyond the doctrinal definition of "forcible entry" to define entry operations as "the projection and immediate employment of military forces from the sea or through the air onto foreign territory to accomplish assigned missions."</p>
<p>The five purposes of entry operations are:
<ul class="body">
	<li class="body">To defeat threats to the global commons</li>
	<li class="body">To control, defeat, disable, or dispose of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) threats</li>
	<li class="body">To conduct other limited duration missions</li>
	<li class="body">To assist populations and groups</li>
	<li class="body">To establish a lodgment</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Rapid Aggregation Concept Targets Response Time</p>
<p>Like the JOAC and the JCEO, as a supporting concept to the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations: Joint Force 2020 (CCJO), the Joint Concept for Rapid Aggregation (JCRA) focuses on the capabilities, relationships, and implementing mechanisms necessary to reduce response times and smooth transition to crisis in support of Globally Integrated Operations circa 2020 and beyond.  As a global power with global interests, the U.S. must maintain the capability to project credible military force into any region of the world in support of its interests and its Unified Action partners.  Inherent in force projection is the requirement to quickly identify the necessary component parts for the response and their interdependencies, deploy them as required, and to aggregate the parts for employment along with other Unified Action mission partners.</p>
<p>This concept describes past challenges to capability aggregation and the challenges the future environment will pose going forward; it offers a new way of operating based on the central idea of dynamic convergence, and finally, it establishes requirements for the capabilities necessary to execute the concept as described.  It is in its initial coordination stages and JACD will participate as a member of the core writing team.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Conclusion</p>
<p>ARCIC Concept writers will continue to articulate Army capabilities, equities, and perspectives during the Joint Concept development process, as they've done in the writing of the JOAC, JCEO, and the JCRA.  Together with Joint partners, ARCIC works to ensure that the Joint Force can access any operational area, and rapidly aggregate capabilities once there.</p>
