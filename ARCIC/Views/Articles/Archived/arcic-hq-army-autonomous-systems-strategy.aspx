    <p id="mainContent">The strategy, informed by some war-gaming and through an Army Warfighting Assessment at Fort Bliss, Texas, seeks to achieve “six main things” through the use of robots and autonomous systems, McMaster teased out.
        The first is these systems should help protect the force at increased standoff distances, McMaster said: “They allow you to hopefully gain contact with the enemy under favorable conditions.”
        Secondly, robots and autonomy-enabled systems can help improve situational awareness and provide persistent monitoring of the environment, he added. However, this doesn’t just mean to transmit visual observations, McMaster said, but will also have “other means of information collection so you can understand your environment better.”
