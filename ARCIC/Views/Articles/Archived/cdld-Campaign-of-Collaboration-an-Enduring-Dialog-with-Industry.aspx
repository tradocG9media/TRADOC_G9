<p>As the Army Operating Concept challenges us in developing future forces, we must anticipate changing conditions to ensure that Army forces are manned, trained, and equipped to overmatch enemies in order to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative.  New technologies have the potential to simplify systems, increase our capabilities, reduce the cost of operation and ensure resiliency.  To increase the rate of innovation the Army needs an engagement strategy to help inform a wider selection of industry about the Army’s emerging capability needs and includes the industrial base earlier in the discussions as we move from concepts to capabilities.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2004, the Technology Information Exchange (TIE) program emerged from discussions between the then U.S. Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Commanding General, Gen. Kevin P. Byrnes, and senior industry leaders.  Our initial TIE meeting was held at Fort Monroe, VA on 9 November 2004 and then on 16 April 2015, ARCIC hosted our Centennial (100th) TIE.  Just before our TIE in April, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster (Director, ARCIC) provided remarks to a cross section of industry representatives and participants from previous TIEs and cut a commemorative cake (see Photo) with Mr. Timothy Winter, Vice President, Northrop Grumman Information Systems.</p>
<p>One key aspect of this program was to arrange a dialogue with industry on corporate/company Independent Research and Development (IRAD) investments.  The initial TIE program was designed to bring a different industry/corporation/company to the Futures Center each month for a two hour dialogue about potential capabilities.  These sessions were not intended to be a series of briefings; they were to be a dialogue between the Futures Center and industry leadership at the executive level.  A General Officer or equivalent from the Futures Center hosted each session and our intent was to provide input to help industry focus their IRAD program towards existing and future Army capability needs.</p>
<p>Northrop Grumman volunteered to be the first participant in the Futures Center TIE program in 2004.</p>

<p>Since that initial TIE over a decade ago, thirty eight companies have participated in the TIE process.  Many mechanics of the TIE have changed over the years such as the addition of secure video teleconference connections for the TRADOC Centers of Excellence, U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command and Headquarters, Department of the Army in 2011, and formalizing the roles and tasks for members of ARCIC and TRADOC under a TRADOC Task Order in August 2014.</p>
<p>To help focus discussion, participants are asked to relate the proposed capabilities to Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs), Learning Demands, and the Army Operating Concept.  All of these are available within this site.</p>
<p>One thing that has remained constant after 100 TIEs is the founding goal for this program which is to establish a dialogue with industry on corporate/company IRAD investment.  Events like the TIE provide us an opportunity to clarify future force development priorities to inform IRAD allocation.  They also allow Combat and Concept Developers to understand emerging technologies with potential application to military operations and to identify ways that TRADOC can simplify and improve the concepts to capabilities process.</p>
<p>During the TIE event, TRADOC can identify ideas to include in the Campaign of Learning as well as help industry to refine ideas and prototypes by identifying opportunities for participating in experiments such as the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment, Network Integration Experiment, Army Warfighting Assessment, etc.</p>
