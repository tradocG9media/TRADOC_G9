<p>The U.S. Army Operating Concept:  Win in a Complex World 2020-2040, "describes how future Army forces will prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars while operating as part of our Joint Force and working with multiple partners."<span class="endnoteRef">[1]</span>  In order to "win in a complex world," the Army Operating Concept (AOC) emphasizes that "Army forces must provide the Joint Force with multiple options, integrate the efforts of multiple partners, operate across multiple domains, and present our enemies and adversaries with multiple dilemmas."<span class="endnoteRef">[2]</span>  In this context, the current and future Army watercraft fleet supports the AOC idea of joint combined arms operations:  an expansion of the traditional concept of combined arms to include the integration of not only joint capabilities, but also the broad range of efforts necessary to accomplish the mission.<span class="endnoteRef">[3]</span></p>
<p>To conduct joint combined arms operations, Army combined arms teams integrate with other services and mission partners to conduct joint combined arms maneuver – the synchronized application of two or more arms or elements of one service, along with the application of joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities to place the adversary in positions of disadvantage.<span class="endnoteRef">[4]</span>  The most important idea to understanding the role of future Army forces in joint combined arms maneuver is that "Army operations are inherently cross-domain operations. U.S. forces depend on and complement joint efforts in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains to enable operations on land."<span class="endnoteRef">[5]</span></p>
<p>As the Army takes on the challenges of developing the future force, it will need to closely examine all of its current capabilities in terms of their roles in the kind of interdependent, cross-domain joint force operations envisaged in the joint combined arms maneuver idea.  The purpose of this article is to examine one of those capabilities – the Army's watercraft fleet – and how it can and should fit into a future Army designed to conduct cross-domain joint combined arms maneuver in the complex world described in the AOC.</p>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Army Watercraft:  A Land Power Capability</p>
<p>Section 3062 of United States Code:  Title 10 - ARMED FORCES, states "In general, the Army, within the Department of the Army, includes land combat 	and service forces and such aviation and water transport as may be organic therein. It shall be organized, trained, and equipped primarily for prompt and 	sustained combat incident to operations on land."  Pursuant to Title 10, the Army maintains a small, but versatile watercraft fleet designed to support the Army's land-based mission.  Currently, the Army watercraft fleet includes landing craft capable of moving a variety of forces and cargo, and vessels and other systems, such as tugs, floating cranes, and mobile communications platforms, to support water terminal operations.<span class="endnoteRef">[6]</span>  Unlike naval forces that are designed, resourced and trained to conduct combat operations at sea, the Army's watercraft fleet is designed to provide tactical mobility in support of land-based combat operations.</p>
<p>The Army watercraft fleet provides land forces the capability to move personnel, equipment, and supplies, and conduct heavy sustainment operations through coastal waterways; austere, degraded, or unimproved ports or harbors; and over bare beach environments in support of joint logistics over-the-shore (JLOTS) operations.  The figure below depicts some of the vessels and systems currently in operation in the Army's Watercraft Fleet.</p>

			</div>
<p>Constituting less than one-half of one percent of Army forces, the watercraft fleet is a very small portion of the Army's overall capabilities.  Size notwithstanding, Army watercraft are an effective capability with a long history of operating closely and interdependently with joint and international partners to project and sustain land combat operations:</p>
<ul class="body">
	<li class="body">During World War II, Army watercraft supported amphibious assault and sustainment missions throughout the Pacific, European, and Mediterranean theaters.</li>
	<li class="body">Army watercraft's operational maneuver role in the Korean War is legendary and still relevant today in a Joint Operations Area defined by water.</li>
	<li class="body">Army watercraft supported maneuver and sustainment operations for Allied and US Forces in Vietnam.</li>
	<li class="body">During Operation Desert Storm Army watercraft provided intra-theater movement of Coalition Forces, while also while also supporting two large fixed ports, and conducting JLOTS operations.</li>
	<li class="body">Operations in Somalia demonstrated Army Watercraft capability to provide intra-theater logistical support in theaters lacking extensive modern infrastructure.</li>
	<li class="body">Operations in Haiti proved Army watercraft's cross-domain operations by working in lieu of ground line-haul assets that were bogged down due to weather – Army watercraft demonstrated the ability to defeat the challenges of complex terrain by bypassing degraded road infrastructure to insert and sustain ready-to-fight Special Operations Forces through severely degraded ports.</li>
	<li class="body">During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Army watercraft, operating with U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels were the first to enter Iraqi waters, moving and providing sustainment for U.S. Special Forces operating in the Al Faw Peninsula area.  Army watercraft provided critical capabilities needed to close Navy support to Kuwait Naval Base, while also supporting fixed port operations, JLOTS and inland waterway movements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="BubbleTitleSection">Army Watercraft in Joint Combined Arms Operations</p>
<p>The most important idea to understanding the role of Army watercraft in joint combined arms operations is that "Army operations are inherently cross-domain operations. U.S. forces depend on and complement joint efforts in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains to enable operations on land."<span class="endnoteRef">[7]</span>  To achieve this, future Army forces must possess the ability to operate in the maritime domain<span class="endnoteRef">[8]</span> – the domain for which Army watercraft are uniquely suited.</p>
<p>By giving land force commanders the ability to use coastal waters as maneuver space, Army watercraft can be used to extend the lines of movement, open new avenues of approach, and provide stand-off maneuver capability by avoiding contested or impassable ground lines of communication.  In this context, Army watercraft also play a role in supporting maneuver through the land domain.  Army watercraft provide the ability to operate on rivers and inland waterways (to include lakes accessible from the maritime domain) that are often obstacles to ground-based maneuver forces, enabling land power commanders to turn those obstacles into usable maneuver space.  Framed within the context of the AOC, key themes emerge that provide the basis for understanding the role of Army watercraft – and how this ability to operate in the maritime domain and those parts of the land domain dominated by water – is applied to joint combined arms operations:</p>
<p><b>Expeditionary Maneuver</b><br />A primary idea underpinning how the Army operates is the ability to conduct expeditionary maneuver:  "the rapid deployment of task organized combined arms forces able to transition quickly and conduct operations of sufficient scale and ample duration to achieve strategic objectives, aims to turn the enemy out of prepared positions or envelop forces from unexpected directions."<span class="endnoteRef">[9]</span></p>
<p>The AOC describes Army early entry forces as possessing the capability to achieve surprise by bypassing anti-access and area denial environments by conducting "intertheater and intratheater maneuver to multiple locations."<span class="endnoteRef">[10]</span>  An examination of the Tenets of Army Operations provides insight into the role of Army watercraft in expeditionary maneuver:</p>
<ul class="body">
	<li class="body"><b>Simultaneous Operations:</b> "Simultaneity" describes the Army's ability to operate simultaneously in the land, air, maritime, space and cyberspace domains.<span class="endnoteRef">[11]</span>  Army watercraft, provide tactical-level mobility that enables the Army and other land forces to use the littorals and coastal waters – the maritime domain - as maneuver space.  Employed as a complementary capability to vertical maneuver, waterborne maneuver provides freedom of movement for the land forces while creating multiple dilemmas for adversaries.</li>
	<li class="body"><b>Operations in Depth:</b> "Depth" describes future Army forces capable of projecting power "from land across the air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains to ensure joint force freedom of maneuver."<span class="endnoteRef">[12]</span>  Army watercraft are essential to Army forces that maintain freedom of movement by projecting power across the maritime domain and those areas of the land domain that are dominated by water.  By giving land force commanders the ability to use coastal waters as maneuver space, Army watercraft can be used to extend the lines of movement, open new avenues of approach, and provide stand-off maneuver capability by avoiding contested or impassable ground lines of communication.</li>
	<li class="body"><b>Enduring Operations:</b> "Endurance" requires "the ability to generate, protect, and sustain forces in high tempo operations in austere environments and across wide areas for as long as the commander requires."<span class="endnoteRef">[13]</span>  Endurance across wide areas for protracted time periods will require capabilities to move forces and sustainment in varying quantities throughout the operational environment.  In this context, sustainment cannot be separated from expeditionary maneuver; an idea clearly evidenced in the Army's Movement and Maneuver Concept that identifies distributed support and sustainment as a core operational action.<span class="endnoteRef">[14]</span>  To conduct expeditionary sustainment operations, Army watercraft will be employed in their more traditional role of moving forces, equipment, and supplies along coastal and inland waterways.  Army watercraft have the capacity to carry heavy supplies and equipment, maintain operational tempo even when terrain or weather conditions negate the use of airlift, and provide the land force the option of using waterborne avenues to avoid contested or impassable ground routes.</li>
	<li class="body"><b>Mobility:</b> "Mobility" is the "capability that permits military forces to gain positions of relative advantage, conduct high tempo operations, and concentrate combat power against decisive points while operating dispersed across wide areas."<span class="endnoteRef">[15]</span>  Army watercraft play an essential role in two aspects of mobility.  First, without Army watercraft, the future Army will not have the ability to maneuver through the maritime domain and areas of the land domain dominated by rivers and inland waters.  Army watercraft provide tactical mobility by providing land forces with the ability to use waterborne avenues to conduct maneuver and sustain dispersed operations.  Secondly, Army watercraft provide Army forces with an important interface with maritime operational and strategic mobility capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Entry Operations</b><br />Army watercraft provide Army forces with the ability to conduct entry operations through the maritime domain and those areas of the land domain dominated by rivers and inland waters.  The key role played by Army watercraft in entry operations is threefold:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="body">Army watercraft have the capacity to deliver and sustain land forces that are too heavy to move by air, giving the Army the ability to project power in "sufficient scale and ample duration."  Employed in concert with Army aviation, Army forces can simultaneously deliver light, medium and heavy forces in the right mix at the right time and in the right quantity to achieve joint force operational objectives.</li>
	<li class="body">When employed in formations of vessels, Army watercraft enable tactical dispersion of a relevant force (sufficient scale) without concentrating risk in a tightly massed movement.  A combined arms battalion with a mix of light, medium and heavy forces, can maneuver through the maritime domain on multiple Army watercraft each of which is carrying a tactically relevant sub-element of the battalion.  This will allow simultaneous delivery of the battalion's combat elements over a dispersed space, enhancing force protection and creating multiple dilemmas for the enemy.</li>
	<li class="body">Army watercraft provide the agility and capacity to conduct light and heavy sustainment operations from both land and sea bases to maneuver forces dispersed across the operational area.  Army watercraft enables land forces to use the littorals and waterways to bypass contested ground lines of communication and maintain operational tempo even when environmental conditions mitigate the use of aviation.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Combined Arms Maneuver</b><br />A core competency of the Army of 2020-2040 is the ability to conduct "combined arms maneuver in the land, air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains."<span class="endnoteRef">[16]</span>  In the context of joint combined arms maneuver, Army forces integrate and synchronize warfighting functions with joint, interorganizational, and multinational capabilities, to apply combat power from unexpected directions to create multiple dilemmas for the enemy.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="body"><b>Operations Across Domains:</b> The Army's watercraft fleet is designed, equipped and trained to operate as part of the land force, provides the combined arms commander with the ability to operate in the maritime domain and those areas of the land domain dominated by water.</li>
	<li class="body"><b>Multiple Dilemmas:</b> By enabling operations in the maritime domain, Army watercraft increases the flexibility and options of the land force by extending the maneuver space into the littorals and inland waterways, creating multiple and unexpected dilemmas for enemy forces.</li>
	<li class="body"><b>Joint, Interorganizational, and Multinational Partnerships:</b> Army watercraft have a long history of operating as part of joint operations, particularly with the Navy and other multinational partners in the conduct of joint and multi-national contingency and disaster relief operations.  Army watercraft, by their very nature, provides a key interface with Naval forces and other maritime capabilities that are essential to strategic and operational mobility of land forces.</li>
</ul>

			</div>
<p>The Army vision in the AOC is one that is capable of conducting joint combined arms maneuver across the land, air, maritime and cyberspace domains; an Army capable of integrating with and synchronizing joint, interorganizational, and multinational partners to present unexpected and multiple dilemmas to an enemy adapted to a complex operational environment.  In this context, Army watercraft provides a critical capability to conduct joint combined arms maneuver to, in, from and through the maritime domain and those areas of the land domain dominated by water.</p>
<p>Unlike naval forces that are designed, manned, equipped, and trained to conduct operations at sea, Army watercraft are designed, manned, equipped, and trained as part of the land force.  Employing Army watercraft in concert with its land, air and cyberspace capabilities provides Army forces with the tactical mobility, depth, simultaneity, and endurance to conduct operations across all domains.  Employed in concert with joint, interorganizational and multinational partners, Army watercraft provide the key and essential interfaces needed to synchronize joint combined arms operations to present multiple and unexpected dilemmas for the enemy.  Army watercraft, designed and employed in the context of the ideas presented in the AOC, will provide future Army forces with the ability to move beyond the two-dimensional air-land mindset to one that is based on true cross-domain operations.</p>
