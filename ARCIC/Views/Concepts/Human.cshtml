            <div class="panel-body">
               
                <p class="">Faced with a complex future OE, changing fiscal realities, and continuous engagement as part of unified land operations, the Army will require enhanced capabilities in the cognitive, physical, and social components of the human dimension. These capabilities are necessary for the future Army to win the clash of wills, become more expeditionary while retaining capability, and maintain overmatch over adversaries.</p>
 <br />

                <p class="">The Army recognizes that the American Soldier remains the most discriminately lethal force on the battlefield. In light of the future operational challenges, the Army must invest significantly in the human dimension. This investment requires a unifying, holistic vision: maximized individual and team performance through identification, development, and optimal integration of human capabilities.</p>
