                            <p class="text-left">WASHINGTON (Army News Service) -- The Army's dominance is in danger when it comes to future warfare, according to its senior leaders. While the biggest threat Soldiers have faced in recent wars has been the improvised explosive device, emerging threats from cyberspace, electronic warfare and unmanned aerial vehicles have Army leaders eyeing new tactics across multiple domains. </p>

                            <p class="text-left">One year ago in these pages I published my first article as Army Chief of Staff. In it, I outlined my three priorities: (1) Readiness, (2) Future Force, and (3) People. My priorities have not changed over the past year: readiness remains the #1 priority. The security challenges we face have also not changed: great power competition is returning to a world racked by irregular war and stressed by violent instability and rapid change. Our Army's fundamental purpose--to fight and win our Nation's wars--certainly has not changed. </p>
